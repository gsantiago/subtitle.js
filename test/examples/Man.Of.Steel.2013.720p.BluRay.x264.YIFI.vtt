Man.Of.Steel.2013.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFI

3
00:00:58.525 --> 00:01:00.027
Hurry!

4
00:02:11.031 --> 00:02:14.979
Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.

5
00:02:15.202 --> 00:02:18.547
We may only have a matter of weeks.
I warned you.

6
00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.309
Harvesting the core was suicide.
It has accelerated...

7
00:02:22.542 --> 00:02:25.284
...the process of implosion.
- Our energy reserves...

8
00:02:25.512 --> 00:02:27.890
...were exhausted.
What would you have us do, El?

9
00:02:28.148 --> 00:02:31.561
Look to the stars, like our ancestors did.

10
00:02:31.818 --> 00:02:35.698
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.

11
00:02:35.956 --> 00:02:39.665
Are you seriously suggesting
that we evacuate the entire planet?

12
00:02:39.893 --> 00:02:43.340
No. Everybody here is already dead.

13
00:02:44.164 --> 00:02:47.702
Give me control of the Codex.
I will ensure the survival of our race.

14
00:02:48.669 --> 00:02:49.739
There is still hope.

15
00:02:50.003 --> 00:02:52.506
I have held that hope in my hands.

16
00:03:07.421 --> 00:03:09.560
This council has been disbanded.

17
00:03:10.057 --> 00:03:11.900
On whose authority?

18
00:03:12.259 --> 00:03:13.397
Mine.

19
00:03:18.165 --> 00:03:21.442
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

20
00:03:23.437 --> 00:03:26.008
- What are you doing, Zod? This is madness.
- What I should have done...

21
00:03:26.239 --> 00:03:26.910
...years ago.

22
00:03:27.174 --> 00:03:28.209
These lawmakers...

23
00:03:28.442 --> 00:03:29.546
...with their endless debates...

24
00:03:29.776 --> 00:03:30.914
...have lead Krypton to ruin.

25
00:03:34.281 --> 00:03:35.954
And if your forces prevail...

26
00:03:36.216 --> 00:03:38.856
...you'll be the leader of nothing.
- Then join me.

27
00:03:39.086 --> 00:03:42.192
Help me save our race. We'll start anew.

28
00:03:42.422 --> 00:03:43.457
We'll sever...

29
00:03:43.724 --> 00:03:46.466
...the degenerative bloodlines
that led us to this state.

30
00:03:46.727 --> 00:03:49.970
And who will decide
which bloodlines survive, Zod?

31
00:03:51.531 --> 00:03:52.373
You?

32
00:03:54.901 --> 00:03:56.608
Don't do this, El.

33
00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.316
The last thing I want
is for us to be enemies.

34
00:03:59.573 --> 00:04:02.213
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together.

35
00:04:02.442 --> 00:04:03.443
You've taken up the sword...

36
00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:05.917
...against your own people.

37
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:09.393
I will honor the man you once were, Zod...

38
00:04:09.816 --> 00:04:11.796
...not this monster you've become.

39
00:04:15.088 --> 00:04:16.431
Take him away.

40
00:04:22.596 --> 00:04:23.939
Sir? Is everything all right?

41
00:04:24.164 --> 00:04:25.472
Out of the way.

42
00:04:26.333 --> 00:04:26.936
I said--

43
00:04:43.817 --> 00:04:44.852
Get me Lara.

44
00:04:46.186 --> 00:04:48.359
Jor. Behind you.

45
00:04:52.259 --> 00:04:54.261
Lara, you have to ready the launch.

46
00:04:54.494 --> 00:04:56.167
I'll be with you as soon as I can.

47
00:05:10.977 --> 00:05:12.149
H'Raka!

48
00:05:23.957 --> 00:05:24.992
Hyah!

49
00:05:51.585 --> 00:05:54.327
- Can you see the Codex?
- It's just beneath the central hub.

50
00:05:54.554 --> 00:05:55.692
But I'm compelled to warn you.

51
00:05:55.922 --> 00:05:58.232
Breaching the genesis chamber
is a Class-B crime--

52
00:05:58.491 --> 00:06:02.064
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.

53
00:07:07.227 --> 00:07:09.901
Jar-El, by the authority of General Zed...

54
00:07:10.130 --> 00:07:12.007
...surrender the Codex.

55
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:28.615
Unh!

56
00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:51.340
Ahhh!

57
00:08:00.013 --> 00:08:01.549
Easy, H'Raka.

58
00:08:22.502 --> 00:08:23.742
Did you find a world?

59
00:08:24.337 --> 00:08:26.647
- We have.
- Orbiting a main sequence yellow star...

60
00:08:26.873 --> 00:08:28.181
â€œjust as you said it would.

61
00:08:29.876 --> 00:08:31.480
A young star.

62
00:08:31.845 --> 00:08:33.518
His cells will drink its radiation.

63
00:08:36.649 --> 00:08:38.890
It's a seemingly intelligent population.

64
00:08:39.819 --> 00:08:40.889
He'll be an outcast.

65
00:08:41.888 --> 00:08:43.333
A freak.

66
00:08:44.557 --> 00:08:45.365
They'll kill him.

67
00:08:45.592 --> 00:08:47.037
How?

68
00:08:47.894 --> 00:08:49.100
He'll be a god to them.

69
00:08:51.431 --> 00:08:53.570
What if the ship doesn't make it?

70
00:08:54.534 --> 00:08:55.535
He'll die out there...

71
00:08:56.936 --> 00:08:58.279
...alone.

72
00:09:00.073 --> 00:09:01.848
I can't do it.

73
00:09:02.075 --> 00:09:03.452
I thought I could, but...

74
00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:05.451
- Lara.
- ...now that he's here...

75
00:09:05.912 --> 00:09:07.619
Krypton is doomed.

76
00:09:08.848 --> 00:09:10.691
It's his only chance now.

77
00:09:11.384 --> 00:09:12.954
It's our people's only hope.

78
00:09:14.421 --> 00:09:15.627
What is it, Kelex?

79
00:09:15.889 --> 00:09:17.869
Five attack ships
converging from the east.

80
00:09:18.091 --> 00:09:20.435
Citadel's defenses
are being scanned and evaluated.

81
00:09:20.693 --> 00:09:21.603
I'll upload the Codex.

82
00:09:22.362 --> 00:09:23.773
No, wait.

83
00:09:24.397 --> 00:09:25.239
Lara.

84
00:09:25.465 --> 00:09:28.378
Just let me look at him.

85
00:09:31.771 --> 00:09:34.274
We'll never get to see him walk.

86
00:09:36.709 --> 00:09:38.620
Never hear him say our names.

87
00:09:44.050 --> 00:09:45.461
But out there...

88
00:09:45.718 --> 00:09:47.629
...amongst the stars...

89
00:09:48.988 --> 00:09:50.490
...he will live.

90
00:10:48.548 --> 00:10:49.856
Goodbye, my son.

91
00:10:51.184 --> 00:10:53.721
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.

92
00:11:32.425 --> 00:11:35.235
Concentrate fire on the main doors.

93
00:11:50.577 --> 00:11:51.555
Lady Lara.

94
00:11:51.778 --> 00:11:54.850
- The phantom drives are coming online.
- Proceed to ignition.

95
00:11:55.615 --> 00:11:56.616
General.

96
00:11:56.883 --> 00:12:00.262
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

97
00:12:01.221 --> 00:12:02.632
A launch.

98
00:12:03.790 --> 00:12:06.202
Hold this platform, commander.

99
00:12:18.605 --> 00:12:20.551
I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El.

100
00:12:21.708 --> 00:12:22.709
Surrender it...

101
00:12:22.942 --> 00:12:24.944
...and I'll let you live.

102
00:12:25.578 --> 00:12:28.115
This is a second chance for all of Krypton...

103
00:12:28.381 --> 00:12:30.725
...not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.

104
00:12:32.252 --> 00:12:33.424
What have you done?

105
00:12:33.653 --> 00:12:35.963
We've had a child, Zod.

106
00:12:36.956 --> 00:12:38.333
A boy child.

107
00:12:38.591 --> 00:12:41.595
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

108
00:12:42.562 --> 00:12:44.269
And he will be free.

109
00:12:44.764 --> 00:12:47.244
Free to forge his own destiny.

110
00:12:48.101 --> 00:12:49.580
Heresy.

111
00:12:51.471 --> 00:12:52.142
Destroy it.

112
00:13:01.147 --> 00:13:02.182
Ah!

113
00:13:45.625 --> 00:13:46.626
Lara...

114
00:13:46.793 --> 00:13:48.170
...listen to me.

115
00:13:48.394 --> 00:13:52.035
The Codex is Krypton's future.

116
00:13:52.298 --> 00:13:54.744
Abort the launch.

117
00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.695
No!

118
00:14:45.618 --> 00:14:46.892
Your son, Lara...

119
00:14:48.187 --> 00:14:50.098
...where have you sent him?

120
00:14:53.593 --> 00:14:55.368
His name...

121
00:14:55.595 --> 00:14:56.699
...is Kal...

122
00:14:57.363 --> 00:14:59.206
...son of El.

123
00:15:02.301 --> 00:15:04.645
And he's beyond your reach.

124
00:15:15.281 --> 00:15:16.783
Bring that ship down.

125
00:15:25.124 --> 00:15:26.501
Target locked.

126
00:15:38.237 --> 00:15:39.682
Lay down your weapons.

127
00:15:39.939 --> 00:15:42.010
Your forces are surrounded.

128
00:15:52.118 --> 00:15:53.597
General Zod...

129
00:15:53.820 --> 00:15:56.596
...for the crimes
of murder and high treason...

130
00:15:56.823 --> 00:16:00.032
...the Council has sentenced you
and your fellow insurgents...

131
00:16:01.194 --> 00:16:04.664
...to three hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

132
00:16:06.165 --> 00:16:07.974
Do you have any last words?

133
00:16:11.270 --> 00:16:12.214
You won't kill us yourself!

134
00:16:13.706 --> 00:16:15.845
You wouldn'l sully your hands!
But you'll damn us...

135
00:16:16.108 --> 00:16:18.281
...to a black hole for eternity!

136
00:16:20.346 --> 00:16:21.381
Jor-El was right.

137
00:16:21.647 --> 00:16:25.322
You're a pack of fools,
every last one of you.

138
00:16:26.219 --> 00:16:27.391
And you.

139
00:16:29.121 --> 00:16:31.567
You believe your son is safe?

140
00:16:32.291 --> 00:16:33.998
I will find him.

141
00:16:34.227 --> 00:16:37.538
I will reclaim
what you have taken from us.

142
00:16:39.966 --> 00:16:41.536
I will find him.

143
00:16:42.735 --> 00:16:44.840
I will find him, Lara.

144
00:16:47.907 --> 00:16:50.478
I will find him!

145
00:17:00.319 --> 00:17:02.060
Argh!

146
00:18:31.677 --> 00:18:34.817
Lady Lara, shouldn't you find refuge?

147
00:18:35.615 --> 00:18:38.596
There is no refuge, Kelor.

148
00:18:39.518 --> 00:18:41.498
Jor-El was right.

149
00:18:43.923 --> 00:18:45.334
This is the end.

150
00:18:57.370 --> 00:19:00.283
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

151
00:20:32.431 --> 00:20:33.933
Watch it, dumb-ass!

152
00:20:34.200 --> 00:20:36.703
Keep your eyes open
or you're gonna get squashed.

153
00:20:38.704 --> 00:20:41.150
Where the hell did they find you,
greenhorn?

154
00:20:41.407 --> 00:20:42.886
Let's get this trap in the air.

155
00:20:43.109 --> 00:20:44.645
Gentlemen, secure the deck.

156
00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:47.914
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

157
00:20:48.147 --> 00:20:49.455
Secure the deck.

158
00:20:54.153 --> 00:20:55.723
All civilian boats, stand clear.

159
00:20:55.955 --> 00:20:58.629
The sub-sea valves failed
and the rig is about to explode.

160
00:20:58.891 --> 00:21:01.235
Roger, Coast Guard.
What about the men left inside?

161
00:21:01.460 --> 00:21:03.804
- Forget them. They're dead.
- Greenhorn...

162
00:21:04.063 --> 00:21:06.100
...fetch me my binoculars.

163
00:21:07.633 --> 00:21:08.976
Greenhorn.

164
00:21:17.309 --> 00:21:20.847
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't know
how much longer we can hold out.

165
00:21:31.190 --> 00:21:33.932
This is Coast Guard 6510.
We'll make one more pass then get out.

166
00:21:36.762 --> 00:21:38.867
Wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.

167
00:21:39.131 --> 00:21:39.700
Right here!

168
00:21:45.271 --> 00:21:47.148
Come on, come on! Let's go! Let's go!

169
00:21:47.339 --> 00:21:49.148
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

170
00:21:59.685 --> 00:22:00.857
Get that last guy loaded.

171
00:22:01.120 --> 00:22:02.497
We have got to go.

172
00:22:02.721 --> 00:22:04.394
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?

173
00:22:10.529 --> 00:22:11.633
Go! Go!

174
00:22:13.799 --> 00:22:14.834
Argh!

175
00:22:22.508 --> 00:22:24.010
Argh!

176
00:22:49.535 --> 00:22:51.572
"when Kansas became a territory?

177
00:22:53.772 --> 00:22:54.750
Clark.

178
00:22:56.742 --> 00:22:57.720
Are you listening, Clark?

179
00:23:02.915 --> 00:23:04.861
I asked if you could tell me who first...

180
00:23:05.084 --> 00:23:06.119
...settled Kansas.

181
00:23:19.365 --> 00:23:20.537
Are you all right, Clark?

182
00:23:28.974 --> 00:23:30.385
Clark.

183
00:23:31.610 --> 00:23:32.918
Clark.

184
00:23:36.482 --> 00:23:37.085
Clark!

185
00:23:41.086 --> 00:23:42.622
Clark, come out of there.

186
00:23:42.888 --> 00:23:44.231
Leave me alone.

187
00:23:45.257 --> 00:23:46.827
Clark, I have called your mother.

188
00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.230
Clark?

189
00:23:51.063 --> 00:23:52.167
Ah!

190
00:23:52.331 --> 00:23:53.332
I'm here.

191
00:23:53.599 --> 00:23:55.579
Clark, honey, it's Mom.

192
00:23:57.970 --> 00:23:59.005
Will you open the door?

193
00:23:59.271 --> 00:24:01.251
- What's wrong with him?
- He's such a freak.

194
00:24:01.473 --> 00:24:02.315
Crybaby.

195
00:24:02.574 --> 00:24:05.020
His parents won't even let him play
with other kids.

196
00:24:05.277 --> 00:24:06.278
I know.

197
00:24:06.512 --> 00:24:07.354
Sweetie.

198
00:24:08.514 --> 00:24:10.653
How can I help you if you won't let me in?

199
00:24:10.916 --> 00:24:13.260
The world's too big, Mom.

200
00:24:13.485 --> 00:24:15.123
Then make it small.

201
00:24:17.489 --> 00:24:18.763
Just, um...

202
00:24:21.593 --> 00:24:22.697
...focus on my voice.

203
00:24:25.264 --> 00:24:27.210
Pretend ifs an island...

204
00:24:27.366 --> 00:24:29.277
...out in the ocean.

205
00:24:30.803 --> 00:24:32.111
Can you see it?

206
00:24:35.808 --> 00:24:36.843
I see it.

207
00:24:38.177 --> 00:24:40.179
Then swim towards it, honey.

208
00:24:53.459 --> 00:24:55.302
What's wrong with me, Mom?

209
00:24:57.896 --> 00:24:59.398
Clark.

210
00:24:59.665 --> 00:25:01.167
Clark.

211
00:25:29.828 --> 00:25:31.705
- Did you get everything I need?
- Yep.

212
00:25:31.930 --> 00:25:33.603
Hold it, hold it.

213
00:26:23.449 --> 00:26:24.985
Hey, ass-wipe.

214
00:26:25.551 --> 00:26:27.224
What do you think? You see the game?

215
00:26:27.453 --> 00:26:29.956
- Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?

216
00:26:30.222 --> 00:26:31.895
I wanna hear what he has to say.

217
00:26:34.259 --> 00:26:34.930
Come on...

218
00:26:35.160 --> 00:26:35.831
...dick-splash.

219
00:26:55.614 --> 00:26:58.458
Mos SCREAMING]

220
00:28:16.828 --> 00:28:17.829
My son was there.

221
00:28:18.063 --> 00:28:20.270
He was in the bus.

222
00:28:20.532 --> 00:28:23.342
- He saw what Clark did.
- I know he did.

223
00:28:24.269 --> 00:28:28.274
- I'm sure what he thought he saw was--
- Was an act of God, Jonathan.

224
00:28:29.341 --> 00:28:31.719
This was providence.

225
00:28:35.447 --> 00:28:37.518
I think you're blowing it out of proportion.

226
00:28:37.749 --> 00:28:41.026
No, I'm not. Lana saw it too.

227
00:28:41.253 --> 00:28:42.254
And the Fordham boy.

228
00:28:42.521 --> 00:28:43.727
This isn't the first time...

229
00:28:43.956 --> 00:28:45.902
...Clark's done something like this.

230
00:29:01.240 --> 00:29:03.083
I just wanted to help.

231
00:29:03.542 --> 00:29:06.284
I know you did, but we talked about this.

232
00:29:06.545 --> 00:29:07.819
Right?

233
00:29:08.280 --> 00:29:10.988
Right? We talked about this. You have...

234
00:29:11.483 --> 00:29:14.930
Clark, you have to keep this side
of yourself a secret.

235
00:29:15.387 --> 00:29:19.267
What was I supposed to do?
Just let them die?

236
00:29:24.062 --> 00:29:25.473
Maybe.

237
00:29:27.399 --> 00:29:31.404
There's more at stake here than just our lives,
Clark, or the lives of those around us.

238
00:29:34.339 --> 00:29:35.750
When the world...

239
00:29:36.675 --> 00:29:40.680
When the world finds out what you can do
it's gonna change everything. Our...

240
00:29:40.946 --> 00:29:43.517
Our beliefs, our notions of...

241
00:29:43.782 --> 00:29:46.490
...what it means to be human.
Everything.

242
00:29:46.752 --> 00:29:49.528
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?

243
00:29:49.788 --> 00:29:51.995
She was scared, Clark.

244
00:29:53.125 --> 00:29:53.967
Why?

245
00:29:55.827 --> 00:29:58.671
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

246
00:29:58.930 --> 00:29:59.840
Is she right?

247
00:30:01.967 --> 00:30:03.810
Did God do this to me?

248
00:30:05.370 --> 00:30:06.872
Tell me.

249
00:30:21.653 --> 00:30:23.326
We found you in this.

250
00:30:25.290 --> 00:30:28.237
We were sure the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep...

251
00:30:28.493 --> 00:30:30.473
...but no one ever came.

252
00:30:44.976 --> 00:30:46.649
This was in that chamber with you.

253
00:30:49.181 --> 00:30:50.558
I took it to a metallurgist...

254
00:30:50.816 --> 00:30:52.159
...at Kansas State.

255
00:30:52.384 --> 00:30:54.990
He said whatever it was made from
didn't even...

256
00:30:55.921 --> 00:30:58.697
Didn't even exist on the periodic table.

257
00:31:00.659 --> 00:31:01.831
That's another way of saying...

258
00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.336
...that it's not from this world, Clark.

259
00:31:06.431 --> 00:31:07.705
And neither are you.

260
00:31:10.402 --> 00:31:11.938
You're the answer, son.

261
00:31:12.204 --> 00:31:14.582
You're the answer to
"Are we alone in the universe?"

262
00:31:16.742 --> 00:31:18.187
I don't wanna be.

263
00:31:18.410 --> 00:31:20.287
And I don't blame you, son.

264
00:31:20.879 --> 00:31:23.587
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear.

265
00:31:23.849 --> 00:31:27.262
But you're not just anyone, Clark,
and I have to believe that you were...

266
00:31:28.420 --> 00:31:30.263
That you were sent here for a reason.

267
00:31:31.523 --> 00:31:34.094
All these changes that you're
going through, one day...

268
00:31:34.359 --> 00:31:37.704
One day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing. When that day comes...

269
00:31:37.929 --> 00:31:39.374
...you have to make a choice.

270
00:31:39.598 --> 00:31:43.603
A choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not.

271
00:31:45.370 --> 00:31:48.044
Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son?

272
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:50.651
You are my son.

273
00:31:55.113 --> 00:31:57.115
But somewhere out there you've...

274
00:31:57.816 --> 00:32:01.059
You have another father too,
who gave you another name.

275
00:32:04.122 --> 00:32:04.964
And he sent you here...

276
00:32:05.223 --> 00:32:06.998
...for a reason, Clark.

277
00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:12.435
And even if it takes you the rest of your life,
you owe it to yourself...

278
00:32:12.664 --> 00:32:14.803
...to find out what that reason is.

279
00:32:23.008 --> 00:32:26.854
Bound by wild desire

280
00:32:27.078 --> 00:32:30.116
I fell into a ring of fire

281
00:32:30.282 --> 00:32:32.455
Wait a second.
Aren't you here fer the exercise?

282
00:32:32.684 --> 00:32:34.357
No, there was a change in the plans.

283
00:32:34.619 --> 00:32:36.690
Somebody found something
strange on Ellesmere.

284
00:32:37.255 --> 00:32:39.929
- Aircom's making runs out there all week.
- That rat hole?

285
00:32:40.158 --> 00:32:42.263
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know. It's crazy.

286
00:32:42.494 --> 00:32:44.201
The Americans are there too,
lots of them.

287
00:32:44.463 --> 00:32:47.034
- Anything else?
- They're calling it an anomalous object.

288
00:32:47.299 --> 00:32:49.540
- Whatever that means.
- Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.

289
00:32:49.801 --> 00:32:51.610
- Oh, come on, Chrissy.
- Knock it off.

290
00:32:51.837 --> 00:32:53.282
- Sit down.
- Let me go.

291
00:32:53.505 --> 00:32:55.178
Hey. Leave her alone, man.

292
00:32:59.511 --> 00:33:01.218
Or what, tough guy?

293
00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:05.193
Or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

294
00:33:06.384 --> 00:33:09.456
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

295
00:33:11.957 --> 00:33:12.731
Ooh.

296
00:33:19.397 --> 00:33:21.070
Oh, there he is.

297
00:33:28.373 --> 00:33:30.375
It's not worth it, sweetie.

298
00:33:38.517 --> 00:33:40.895
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.

299
00:33:43.054 --> 00:33:44.863
Strike.

300
00:34:35.407 --> 00:34:36.818
Thanks.

301
00:34:37.642 --> 00:34:38.882
Hi.

302
00:34:39.110 --> 00:34:40.817
Miss Lane. How you doing?

303
00:34:41.079 --> 00:34:43.286
- Good.
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.

304
00:34:43.548 --> 00:34:45.789
How far to the station?

305
00:34:46.251 --> 00:34:49.323
- Camp's just over the rise. I'll walk you over.
- Great.

306
00:34:49.588 --> 00:34:51.795
Joe can take your bags. Joe.

307
00:34:52.057 --> 00:34:53.297
Help her out.

308
00:34:53.558 --> 00:34:56.061
Careful with those. They're heavy.

309
00:34:58.496 --> 00:35:00.134
I gotta confess, Miss Lane...

310
00:35:00.398 --> 00:35:03.242
...I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.

311
00:35:03.635 --> 00:35:07.606
But those pieces you wrote when you were
embedded with the 1st Division were...

312
00:35:07.839 --> 00:35:09.682
Well, they were pretty impressive.

313
00:35:09.941 --> 00:35:13.912
Well, what can I say? I get writer's block
if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.

314
00:35:19.618 --> 00:35:20.619
Miss Lane.

315
00:35:20.852 --> 00:35:23.492
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.
Dr. Emil Hamilton...

316
00:35:23.755 --> 00:35:24.859
...from DARPA.

317
00:35:25.123 --> 00:35:26.295
- You're early.
- Hi.

318
00:35:26.524 --> 00:35:28.003
We were expecting you tomorrow.

319
00:35:28.259 --> 00:35:30.705
Which is why I showed up today.

320
00:35:31.363 --> 00:35:33.536
Look, let's get one thing straight,
guys, okay?

321
00:35:33.798 --> 00:35:36.642
The only reason I'm here
is because we're on Canadian soil...

322
00:35:36.868 --> 00:35:40.315
...and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

323
00:35:40.538 --> 00:35:42.677
So if we're done measuring dicks...

324
00:35:42.941 --> 00:35:45.285
...can you have your people
show me what you found?

325
00:35:47.345 --> 00:35:48.483
NA SA's EOS satellites...

326
00:35:48.713 --> 00:35:50.488
...pinged the anomaly first.

327
00:35:50.715 --> 00:35:53.195
The ice shelf plays hell
on the echo soundings.

328
00:35:53.451 --> 00:35:55.795
- But there's something there.
- A submarine, maybe?

329
00:35:56.021 --> 00:35:56.829
Soviet-era?

330
00:35:57.055 --> 00:35:58.659
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.

331
00:35:58.890 --> 00:36:01.871
Considerably larger than anything
we know they built back then.

332
00:36:02.127 --> 00:36:03.367
But herds the spooky pan.

333
00:36:04.562 --> 00:36:07.042
The ice surrounding the object...

334
00:36:07.298 --> 00:36:10.370
...it's nearly twenty thousand years old.

335
00:36:11.836 --> 00:36:12.678
Miss Lane?

336
00:36:14.039 --> 00:36:15.313
Try not to wander.

337
00:36:15.540 --> 00:36:18.646
Temperatures drop to minus 40
at night around here.

338
00:36:18.877 --> 00:36:21.153
Wouldn't find your body till after spring.

339
00:36:24.149 --> 00:36:25.651
And there you go.

340
00:36:29.220 --> 00:36:30.699
What if I need to tinkle?

341
00:36:31.389 --> 00:36:33.027
There's a bucket in the corner.

342
00:37:07.225 --> 00:37:09.398
Where the hell are you going?

343
00:39:18.723 --> 00:39:20.100
Hello'?

344
00:40:55.586 --> 00:40:58.692
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's all right.

345
00:41:13.004 --> 00:41:14.881
You're hemorrhaging internally...

346
00:41:15.139 --> 00:41:17.517
...and if I don't cauterize this bleed...

347
00:41:18.676 --> 00:41:19.347
How can-l?

348
00:41:19.610 --> 00:41:22.147
I can do things that other people can't.

349
00:41:23.147 --> 00:41:24.285
Now hold my hand.

350
00:41:25.116 --> 00:41:26.686
This is gonna hurt.

351
00:42:28.379 --> 00:42:30.518
What Colonel Hardy
and his team surmised...

352
00:42:30.748 --> 00:42:32.250
...was a Soviet-era submarine...

353
00:42:32.517 --> 00:42:34.963
...was actually something
much more exotic.

354
00:42:35.219 --> 00:42:39.065
An isotope analysis of the surrounding
ice bores suggests that an object...

355
00:42:39.290 --> 00:42:43.136
...had been trapped in the glacier
for over 18, 000 years.

356
00:42:43.394 --> 00:42:44.930
As for my rescuer?

357
00:42:45.196 --> 00:42:47.574
He disappeared during
the object's departure.

358
00:42:47.965 --> 00:42:50.377
A background check revealed
that his work history...

359
00:42:50.601 --> 00:42:52.706
...and identity had been falsified.

360
00:42:52.937 --> 00:42:54.814
The questions raised by my rescuer's...

361
00:42:55.073 --> 00:42:56.916
"existence are frightening to contemplate...

362
00:42:57.141 --> 00:42:58.779
...but I also know what I saw.

363
00:43:00.711 --> 00:43:03.282
"And I have arrived
at the inescapable conclusion...

364
00:43:03.548 --> 00:43:05.550
...that the object and its occupant...

365
00:43:05.783 --> 00:43:07.729
...did not originate on Earth."

366
00:43:09.454 --> 00:43:12.765
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.

367
00:43:12.990 --> 00:43:15.095
What about the contractors
who corroborated...

368
00:43:15.326 --> 00:43:18.500
...my story?
- The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship.

369
00:43:18.763 --> 00:43:20.606
Of course they are. They're supposed to.

370
00:43:20.832 --> 00:43:22.334
It's the Pentagon.

371
00:43:22.600 --> 00:43:24.273
Perry, it's me we're talking about.

372
00:43:24.502 --> 00:43:27.176
- I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.
- Then act like it.

373
00:43:27.438 --> 00:43:29.577
- Print it or I walk.
- You can't.

374
00:43:29.807 --> 00:43:30.842
You're under contract.

375
00:43:33.311 --> 00:43:37.316
I'm not running a story
about aliens walking among us.

376
00:43:43.621 --> 00:43:45.191
Never gonna happen.

377
00:43:48.459 --> 00:43:50.837
That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady.

378
00:43:51.095 --> 00:43:52.369
I'm sending you the article.

379
00:43:52.630 --> 00:43:55.110
My editor won't print it,
but if it leaked online...

380
00:43:55.333 --> 00:43:56.641
Got it.

381
00:43:56.868 --> 00:43:59.314
But didn't you once describe my site...

382
00:43:59.537 --> 00:44:02.347
...as a creeping cancer of falsehoods?

383
00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:05.511
I stand by my words, Woodburn,
but I want this story...

384
00:44:05.776 --> 00:44:06.948
...out there.
- Why?

385
00:44:07.979 --> 00:44:11.324
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

386
00:44:25.663 --> 00:44:27.643
Recursive diagnostics complete.

387
00:44:28.466 --> 00:44:30.673
Guiding presence authenticated.

388
00:44:30.902 --> 00:44:33.473
All systems operational.

389
00:44:45.550 --> 00:44:49.498
To see you standing there
having grown into an adult...

390
00:44:51.722 --> 00:44:53.565
If only Lara could have witnessed this.

391
00:44:54.692 --> 00:44:55.898
Who are you?

392
00:44:56.894 --> 00:44:58.874
I am your father, Kal.

393
00:45:00.231 --> 00:45:02.108
Or at least a shadow of him.

394
00:45:02.600 --> 00:45:04.341
His consciousness.

395
00:45:06.103 --> 00:45:09.209
My name was Jor-El.

396
00:45:11.876 --> 00:45:13.514
And Kal?

397
00:45:16.747 --> 00:45:17.953
That's my name.

398
00:45:18.849 --> 00:45:22.058
It is.

399
00:45:22.753 --> 00:45:24.790
I have so many questions.

400
00:45:27.525 --> 00:45:29.129
Where do I come from?

401
00:45:30.861 --> 00:45:32.738
Why did you send me here?

402
00:45:33.564 --> 00:45:35.441
You came from Krypton.

403
00:45:38.135 --> 00:45:42.140
A world with a much harsher environment
than Earths.

404
00:45:45.943 --> 00:45:47.581
Long ago...

405
00:45:47.812 --> 00:45:50.053
...in an era of expansion...

406
00:45:50.281 --> 00:45:53.490
...our race spread out through the stars...

407
00:45:53.751 --> 00:45:56.459
...seeking new worlds to settle upon.

408
00:45:57.588 --> 00:46:01.092
This scout ship was
one of thousands launched into the void.

409
00:46:03.661 --> 00:46:06.267
We built outposts on other planets...

410
00:46:06.497 --> 00:46:10.240
musing great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

411
00:46:12.436 --> 00:46:16.441
For 100,000 years,
our civilization ï¬‚ourished...

412
00:46:17.975 --> 00:46:19.977
...accomplishing wonders.

413
00:46:21.145 --> 00:46:22.783
What happened?

414
00:46:24.782 --> 00:46:27.854
Artificial population control
was established.

415
00:46:28.586 --> 00:46:32.193
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned.

416
00:46:32.790 --> 00:46:35.361
We exhausted our natural resources.

417
00:46:35.626 --> 00:46:39.631
As a result,
our planet's core became unstable.

418
00:46:42.099 --> 00:46:44.636
Eventually, our military leader...

419
00:46:44.869 --> 00:46:48.783
...General Zod, attempted a coup.

420
00:46:50.708 --> 00:46:52.881
But by then it was too late.

421
00:46:54.145 --> 00:46:56.785
Your mother and I foresaw
the coming calamity...

422
00:46:57.014 --> 00:46:59.824
...and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

423
00:47:01.886 --> 00:47:03.524
This is a genesis chamber.

424
00:47:04.388 --> 00:47:07.528
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

425
00:47:07.792 --> 00:47:11.501
Every child was designed to fulfill
a pare-determined role in our society...

426
00:47:11.729 --> 00:47:12.571
...as a worker...

427
00:47:12.830 --> 00:47:15.970
...a warrior, a leader and so on.

428
00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:19.477
Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

429
00:47:19.704 --> 00:47:21.911
The element of choice, of chance.

430
00:47:22.406 --> 00:47:24.579
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something...

431
00:47:24.842 --> 00:47:27.345
mother than what society
had intended for him or her?

432
00:47:28.879 --> 00:47:31.485
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

433
00:47:32.249 --> 00:47:34.251
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

434
00:47:34.518 --> 00:47:36.998
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

435
00:47:38.089 --> 00:47:40.763
That's why we risked so much to save you.

436
00:47:41.892 --> 00:47:43.337
Why didn't you come with me?

437
00:47:46.864 --> 00:47:48.605
We couldn't, Kal.

438
00:47:49.667 --> 00:47:50.668
No matter how much...

439
00:47:50.901 --> 00:47:52.107
...we wanted to.

440
00:47:52.603 --> 00:47:54.605
No matter how much we loved you.

441
00:47:55.373 --> 00:47:56.750
Your mother, Lara, and I...

442
00:47:57.007 --> 00:48:00.113
...were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was...

443
00:48:00.378 --> 00:48:02.051
...tied to its fate.

444
00:48:02.279 --> 00:48:04.350
- So I'm alone.
- No.

445
00:48:06.083 --> 00:48:09.758
You're as much a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

446
00:48:10.020 --> 00:48:13.194
You can embody the best of both worlds.

447
00:48:13.424 --> 00:48:17.065
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

448
00:48:21.599 --> 00:48:24.580
The people of Earth
are different from us, it's true.

449
00:48:24.802 --> 00:48:27.749
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.

450
00:48:27.972 --> 00:48:30.418
They won't necessarily
make the same mistakes we did.

451
00:48:30.641 --> 00:48:32.621
Not if you guide them, Kal.

452
00:48:34.211 --> 00:48:36.248
Not if you give them hope.

453
00:48:39.650 --> 00:48:41.823
That's what this symbol means.

454
00:48:42.553 --> 00:48:44.897
The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

455
00:48:45.122 --> 00:48:47.625
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief...

456
00:48:47.892 --> 00:48:51.806
...in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

457
00:48:52.930 --> 00:48:54.967
That's what you can bring them.

458
00:49:15.152 --> 00:49:16.995
Why am I so different from them?

459
00:49:18.255 --> 00:49:20.758
Earth's sun is younger and brighter
than Krypton's was.

460
00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.038
Your cells have drunken its radiation...

461
00:49:25.296 --> 00:49:29.301
â€œstrengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.

462
00:49:29.834 --> 00:49:33.839
Earth's gravity is weaker,
yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.

463
00:49:35.139 --> 00:49:38.143
You've grown stronger here
than I ever could have imagined.

464
00:49:38.375 --> 00:49:39.979
The only way to know how strong...

465
00:49:41.045 --> 00:49:44.185
...is to keep testing your limits.

466
00:50:02.967 --> 00:50:03.638
Unh!

467
00:50:11.342 --> 00:50:13.185
Uh-- Oh.

468
00:50:14.812 --> 00:50:16.086
Whoa!

469
00:50:36.433 --> 00:50:40.438
You will give the people ofEart/v
an ideal to strive towards.

470
00:50:42.106 --> 00:50:43.915
They'll race behind you.

471
00:50:44.174 --> 00:50:45.551
They will stumble.

472
00:50:45.776 --> 00:50:46.914
They will fall.

473
00:50:47.177 --> 00:50:48.884
But in time...

474
00:50:50.414 --> 00:50:53.054
...they will join you in the sun, Kal.

475
00:50:54.552 --> 00:50:56.259
In time...

476
00:50:56.587 --> 00:50:59.193
you will help them accomplish wonders.

477
00:52:21.605 --> 00:52:25.553
How do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks?

478
00:52:25.943 --> 00:52:27.547
You start with the urban legends...

479
00:52:27.811 --> 00:52:30.155
- ...that have sprung up in his wake.
- That's Joe.

480
00:52:30.381 --> 00:52:31.792
The friends of a friend...

481
00:52:32.016 --> 00:52:34.018
- ...who have seen him.
- He worked here.

482
00:52:34.284 --> 00:52:37.128
For some he was a guardian angel.
For others, a cipher...

483
00:52:37.354 --> 00:52:39.129
...a ghost who never quite fit in.

484
00:52:40.024 --> 00:52:41.503
Well, I was saying we were...

485
00:52:41.725 --> 00:52:42.965
...coming towards the oil rig.

486
00:52:43.193 --> 00:52:46.333
As you work your way back in time,
the stories form a pattern.

487
00:52:47.064 --> 00:52:49.135
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?

488
00:52:49.366 --> 00:52:52.210
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road...

489
00:52:54.138 --> 00:52:54.843
Pete Ross?

490
00:52:57.174 --> 00:53:00.383
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
when you were younger.

491
00:53:00.644 --> 00:53:03.147
A school bus that went into the river.

492
00:53:08.652 --> 00:53:10.757
Dusty. Shh-shh-shh.

493
00:53:10.921 --> 00:53:11.991
Mrs. Kent?

494
00:53:12.923 --> 00:53:14.869
I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the Daily Planet.

495
00:53:15.926 --> 00:53:16.666
Quiet.

496
00:53:18.262 --> 00:53:21.732
I'm from the Daily Planet
and I'd like to talk to you about your son.

497
00:53:39.850 --> 00:53:43.855
I figured if I turned over enough stones
you'd eventually find me.

498
00:53:49.426 --> 00:53:52.464
Where are you from?
What are you doing here?

499
00:53:52.730 --> 00:53:54.073
Let me tell your story.

500
00:53:54.298 --> 00:53:57.438
What if I don't want my story told?

501
00:53:57.701 --> 00:53:59.476
It's going to come out eventually.

502
00:53:59.737 --> 00:54:02.775
Somebody's going to get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

503
00:54:03.040 --> 00:54:05.987
- Then I'll disappear again.
- The only way you could disappear...

504
00:54:06.243 --> 00:54:10.248
...is to stop helping people altogether,
and I sense that's not an option for you.

505
00:54:14.418 --> 00:54:18.423
My father believed that if the world
found out who I really was...

506
00:54:20.424 --> 00:54:21.425
...they'd reject me...

507
00:54:22.159 --> 00:54:23.797
...out of fear.

508
00:54:25.829 --> 00:54:27.900
I'm tired of safe.

509
00:54:28.132 --> 00:54:30.237
I just wanna do something useful
with my life.

510
00:54:30.467 --> 00:54:33.073
So farming, feeding people.
That's not useful?

511
00:54:33.303 --> 00:54:34.145
I didn't say that.

512
00:54:34.404 --> 00:54:36.509
Our family's been farming
for five generations.

513
00:54:36.774 --> 00:54:38.685
Your family, not mine.

514
00:54:38.942 --> 00:54:41.923
I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
You're not my dad.

515
00:54:42.146 --> 00:54:43.523
You're just some guy
who found me in a field.

516
00:54:43.781 --> 00:54:44.953
Clark.

517
00:54:47.317 --> 00:54:48.990
It's all right, Martha.

518
00:54:50.821 --> 00:54:52.926
He's right. Clark has a point.

519
00:54:53.490 --> 00:54:54.525
We're not your parents.

520
00:54:56.627 --> 00:54:58.334
But we've been doing the best we can.

521
00:54:58.595 --> 00:55:01.974
And we've been making this up
as we go along, so maybe...

522
00:55:02.199 --> 00:55:04.611
Maybe our best
isn't good enough anymore.

523
00:55:09.640 --> 00:55:11.677
Look, Dad--

524
00:55:11.942 --> 00:55:13.387
Hold on.

525
00:55:33.130 --> 00:55:34.837
Go for the overpass.

526
00:55:36.633 --> 00:55:37.737
Go for the overpass!

527
00:55:40.070 --> 00:55:41.708
Take cover! Take cover!

528
00:55:41.972 --> 00:55:44.350
- Over there. Just follow them.
- Take cover.

529
00:55:48.078 --> 00:55:49.250
She's stuck.

530
00:55:53.817 --> 00:55:55.694
Hank's still in the car.

531
00:55:56.520 --> 00:55:57.555
Hank's in the car.

532
00:55:58.422 --> 00:56:00.561
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No, no.

533
00:56:01.091 --> 00:56:03.332
Get your mom to the overpass.

534
00:56:21.712 --> 00:56:23.521
Hank! Hank! Come!

535
00:56:32.422 --> 00:56:33.628
Jonathan!
- Mom, ifs okay.

536
00:56:54.645 --> 00:56:56.090
- Jonathan!
- Mom, stay here.

537
00:57:21.905 --> 00:57:24.408
Dad!

538
00:57:26.944 --> 00:57:30.016
I let my father die because I trusted him.

539
00:57:30.914 --> 00:57:34.828
Because he was convinced
that I had to wait.

540
00:57:35.585 --> 00:57:37.758
That the world was not ready.

541
00:57:39.489 --> 00:57:41.127
What do you think?

542
00:57:46.029 --> 00:57:47.667
You better watch out, Lois.

543
00:57:48.165 --> 00:57:50.475
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

544
00:57:50.701 --> 00:57:54.478
He knows you're Woodburns anonymous
source and cannot wait to rip you a new one.

545
00:57:56.840 --> 00:57:58.285
Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha.

546
00:58:00.277 --> 00:58:02.814
I told you not to run with this,
and what do you do?

547
00:58:03.046 --> 00:58:05.549
You let Wood burn just shotgun it
all over the Internet.

548
00:58:05.816 --> 00:58:08.695
Now the publishers want me to sue you.

549
00:58:08.952 --> 00:58:12.195
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.

550
00:58:12.456 --> 00:58:13.457
Whoa, just like that?

551
00:58:13.690 --> 00:58:14.691
Yep.

552
00:58:15.058 --> 00:58:16.366
What happened to your leads?

553
00:58:17.027 --> 00:58:19.667
They didn't pan out. The story is smoke.

554
00:58:19.896 --> 00:58:21.842
Or it didn't get the traction you hoped?

555
00:58:24.201 --> 00:58:25.043
Two weeks leave...

556
00:58:25.302 --> 00:58:26.906
...no pay, that's your penance.

557
00:58:27.170 --> 00:58:28.843
You try something like this again...

558
00:58:29.072 --> 00:58:30.745
...you're done here.
- Fine.

559
00:58:31.008 --> 00:58:33.716
Let's make it three weeks
since you're so willing to agree.

560
00:58:33.977 --> 00:58:35.479
- Perry.
- No, no. Don't. Don't.

561
00:58:37.147 --> 00:58:38.820
I believe you saw something, Lois.

562
00:58:39.316 --> 00:58:42.320
But not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold.

563
00:58:42.552 --> 00:58:46.056
So whatever your reasons are
for dropping it...

564
00:58:47.090 --> 00:58:48.933
...I think you're doing the right thing.

565
00:58:49.493 --> 00:58:50.733
Why?

566
00:58:52.095 --> 00:58:55.736
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

567
00:58:58.001 --> 00:59:01.448
...if they knew there was
someone like this out there?

568
00:59:19.589 --> 00:59:20.590
Go get him.

569
00:59:27.431 --> 00:59:29.069
Well, look at you.

570
00:59:46.116 --> 00:59:47.925
A reporter came by here.

571
00:59:48.485 --> 00:59:50.726
She's a friend. Don't worry.

572
00:59:51.455 --> 00:59:52.798
Oh.

573
00:59:53.723 --> 00:59:54.599
Mom.

574
00:59:54.758 --> 00:59:56.499
- Heh, heh, heh.
- What'?

575
00:59:57.961 --> 01:00:00.498
- I found them.
- Who?

576
01:00:01.331 --> 01:00:02.833
My parents.

577
01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:05.343
My People.

578
01:00:06.236 --> 01:00:09.445
I know where I come from now.

579
01:00:10.841 --> 01:00:12.115
Wow.

580
01:00:13.176 --> 01:00:14.951
That's wonderful.

581
01:00:16.813 --> 01:00:19.259
I'm so happy for you, Clark.

582
01:00:28.091 --> 01:00:30.628
What?
- it's nothing.

583
01:00:33.330 --> 01:00:36.277
When you were a baby I used to lay
by your crib at night...

584
01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:38.878
...listening to you breathe.

585
01:00:39.936 --> 01:00:41.540
It was hard for you.

586
01:00:42.772 --> 01:00:44.149
You struggled.

587
01:00:44.374 --> 01:00:46.217
And I worried all the time.

588
01:00:46.476 --> 01:00:48.319
You worried the truth would come out.

589
01:00:49.846 --> 01:00:51.052
No.

590
01:00:52.015 --> 01:00:54.621
The truth about you is beautiful.

591
01:00:55.051 --> 01:00:58.498
We saw that the moment
we laid eyes on you.

592
01:01:00.790 --> 01:01:04.795
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

593
01:01:07.230 --> 01:01:08.868
I'm just...

594
01:01:09.499 --> 01:01:11.570
I'm worried they'll take you away from me.

595
01:01:13.803 --> 01:01:16.181
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.

596
01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:19.510
I promise.

597
01:01:25.715 --> 01:01:27.888
General Swanwick, sir.

598
01:01:28.151 --> 01:01:31.894
What am I looking at, doc?
Comet? Asteroid?

599
01:01:33.056 --> 01:01:37.061
Comets don't make
course corrections, general.

600
01:01:39.863 --> 01:01:43.868
Wanted you to see this before some amateur
with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.

601
01:01:45.535 --> 01:01:46.912
The ship appears to have...

602
01:01:47.170 --> 01:01:49.912
...inserted itself into
a lunar synchronous orbit...

603
01:01:50.173 --> 01:01:52.346
...though I have no idea why.

604
01:01:52.576 --> 01:01:55.420
Have you tried... communicating with it?

605
01:01:55.679 --> 01:01:59.684
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.

606
01:02:00.951 --> 01:02:04.956
I'm just speculating, but I think
whoever? at the helm of that thing...

607
01:02:05.222 --> 01:02:07.725
...is looking to make a dramatic entrance.

608
01:02:14.598 --> 01:02:16.043
Anybody know where we keep the toner?

609
01:02:17.033 --> 01:02:18.944
- What's going on?
- it's all over the news.

610
01:02:19.202 --> 01:02:21.148
You gotta see this.

611
01:02:48.131 --> 01:02:49.633
Clark.

612
01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:51.138
Yeah?

613
01:02:51.401 --> 01:02:52.744
Coming.

614
01:02:53.069 --> 01:02:55.106
This is a breaking news. An unidentified...

615
01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:39.051
You are not alone.

616
01:03:40.717 --> 01:03:43.061
You are not alone.

617
01:03:44.988 --> 01:03:47.229
You are not alone.

618
01:03:52.896 --> 01:03:55.502
You are not alone.

619
01:04:20.924 --> 01:04:22.426
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.

620
01:04:22.692 --> 01:04:24.569
You are not alone.

621
01:04:25.195 --> 01:04:27.232
It's on my phone too.

622
01:04:29.399 --> 01:04:31.845
My name is General Zod.

623
01:04:33.670 --> 01:04:36.446
Icome from a world far from yours.

624
01:04:37.841 --> 01:04:41.846
I have journeyed across
an ocean of stars to reach you.

625
01:04:43.947 --> 01:04:47.952
For some time, your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.

626
01:04:48.585 --> 01:04:51.794
I request that you return this individual...

627
01:04:52.055 --> 01:04:54.194
...to my custody.

628
01:04:54.424 --> 01:04:58.429
For reasons unknown,
he has chosen to keep his existence...

629
01:04:58.695 --> 01:05:00.538
...a secret from you.

630
01:05:01.598 --> 01:05:04.772
He will have made efforts to blend in.

631
01:05:05.368 --> 01:05:07.041
He will look like you.

632
01:05:07.771 --> 01:05:10.377
But he is not one of you.

633
01:05:11.574 --> 01:05:13.417
To those of you who may know...

634
01:05:13.643 --> 01:05:15.645
...of his current location...

635
01:05:15.912 --> 01:05:18.449
mine fare of your planer."...

636
01:05:18.715 --> 01:05:21.389
...rests in your hands.

637
01:05:22.452 --> 01:05:25.490
To Kai-El, <i>I</i> say this:

638
01:05:27.557 --> 01:05:30.231
Surrender within 24 hours...

639
01:05:34.497 --> 01:05:37.478
...or watch this world
suffer the consequences.

640
01:05:41.404 --> 01:05:42.075
Ah!

641
01:05:53.249 --> 01:05:55.092
We hardly know anything
about him, isn't that right?

642
01:05:55.251 --> 01:05:57.253
If he truly means us no harm...

643
01:05:57.487 --> 01:05:59.489
...he'll turn himself in
and face the consequences.

644
01:06:00.123 --> 01:06:01.329
And if he won't do that...

645
01:06:01.591 --> 01:06:03.593
...then maybe we should.

646
01:06:03.827 --> 01:06:06.808
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane
knows who this guy is. Shek...

647
01:06:07.030 --> 01:06:07.940
...the one we should
be questioning.

648
01:06:08.932 --> 01:06:11.674
- Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane--
- Hello?

649
01:06:11.935 --> 01:06:14.438
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

650
01:06:14.671 --> 01:06:16.981
For once I agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?

651
01:06:17.207 --> 01:06:20.518
- Do you know where he is?
- No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.

652
01:06:20.777 --> 01:06:23.951
The entire world is being threatened here.

653
01:06:24.180 --> 01:06:25.818
This is not time for you to fall...

654
01:06:26.049 --> 01:06:28.393
...back on journalistic integrity.

655
01:06:28.651 --> 01:06:30.130
This is serious, Lois.

656
01:06:30.353 --> 01:06:33.334
The FBI is here. They're throwing around
words like "treason."

657
01:06:33.556 --> 01:06:35.229
I gotta go-

658
01:06:51.374 --> 01:06:52.717
FBI. Hands up.

659
01:06:52.976 --> 01:06:54.751
Drop the bag. Now.

660
01:07:01.651 --> 01:07:03.892
Regarding the visitors
themselves we know...

661
01:07:04.153 --> 01:07:06.599
very little.
According to government officials...

662
01:07:06.856 --> 01:07:09.336
...the visitors do not represent a threat...

663
01:07:09.559 --> 01:07:11.732
<i>despite the ominous tone</i>
<i>of their message.</i>

664
01:07:11.995 --> 01:07:14.498
Then of course there's the question
on everyonek mind:

665
01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:18.543
"Who is this Kal-El person?
Does he actually exist?

666
01:07:18.768 --> 01:07:21.442
How could he have remained
hidden from us for so long?"

667
01:07:26.075 --> 01:07:27.383
Come on, Kent.

668
01:07:34.450 --> 01:07:35.554
Come on. Fight back.

669
01:07:35.785 --> 01:07:37.389
Get up, Kent.

670
01:07:40.690 --> 01:07:42.067
So is that it?

671
01:07:42.525 --> 01:07:44.027
Is that all you've got?

672
01:07:45.695 --> 01:07:47.197
Come on, Kent.

673
01:07:48.431 --> 01:07:49.808
Come on!

674
01:08:18.428 --> 01:08:19.566
Did they hurl you?

675
01:08:20.830 --> 01:08:22.241
You know they can't.

676
01:08:22.599 --> 01:08:25.478
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?

677
01:08:27.470 --> 01:08:29.780
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him bad.

678
01:08:30.006 --> 01:08:31.485
I know you did. I mean...

679
01:08:31.741 --> 01:08:34.449
...part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

680
01:08:35.144 --> 01:08:36.316
Make you feel any better?

681
01:08:39.682 --> 01:08:43.687
You just have to decide what kind of man
you want to grow up to be, Clark.

682
01:08:43.953 --> 01:08:47.662
Because whoever that man is,
good character or bad, he's...

683
01:08:49.292 --> 01:08:51.431
He's gonna change the world.

684
01:08:56.666 --> 01:08:57.701
What's on your mind?

685
01:09:03.773 --> 01:09:05.047
I don't know where to start.

686
01:09:05.675 --> 01:09:07.279
Wherever you want.

687
01:09:09.445 --> 01:09:11.550
That ship that appeared last night.

688
01:09:12.882 --> 01:09:14.691
I'm the one they're looking for.

689
01:09:19.188 --> 01:09:20.690
Do you know...

690
01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:22.629
...why they want you?

691
01:09:22.859 --> 01:09:25.465
No. But this General Zod...

692
01:09:25.695 --> 01:09:29.700
...even if I surrender, there's no guarantee
he'll keep his word, but...

693
01:09:29.966 --> 01:09:33.971
...if there's a chance I can save Earth
by turning myself in...

694
01:09:35.571 --> 01:09:36.709
...shouldn't I take it'?

695
01:09:38.207 --> 01:09:40.084
What does your gut tell you?

696
01:09:40.810 --> 01:09:42.517
Zod can't be trusted.

697
01:09:45.148 --> 01:09:46.718
The problem is...

698
01:09:47.750 --> 01:09:50.356
...I'm not sure the people of Earth
can be either.

699
01:09:58.361 --> 01:10:01.342
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first.

700
01:10:02.732 --> 01:10:04.769
The trust part comes later.

701
01:10:28.925 --> 01:10:31.633
All right. You've got our attention.

702
01:10:32.128 --> 01:10:33.129
What is it you want?

703
01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.205
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

704
01:10:35.431 --> 01:10:36.705
What makes you think she's here?

705
01:10:37.633 --> 01:10:39.704
Don't play games with me, general.

706
01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:43.941
I'll surrender, but only if you
guarantee Lois's freedom.

707
01:10:54.050 --> 01:10:55.996
Why are you surrendering to Zod?

708
01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:00.827
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.

709
01:11:01.958 --> 01:11:03.904
You let them handcuff you?

710
01:11:04.627 --> 01:11:07.073
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

711
01:11:08.564 --> 01:11:10.601
And if it makes them feel more secure...

712
01:11:11.667 --> 01:11:13.510
...then all the better for it.

713
01:11:17.940 --> 01:11:19.112
What's the S stand for?

714
01:11:22.745 --> 01:11:24.315
It's not an S.

715
01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:27.352
On my world it means hope.

716
01:11:29.318 --> 01:11:32.822
Well, here, it's an S.

717
01:11:34.857 --> 01:11:36.427
How about...

718
01:11:40.763 --> 01:11:41.764
...Super--

719
01:11:41.998 --> 01:11:43.033
Sir?

720
01:11:43.299 --> 01:11:46.644
- Hi, my name is Dr. E--
Emil Hamilton.

721
01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:49.850
I know, I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket.

722
01:11:50.106 --> 01:11:52.143
Along with a half-eaten roll of Lifesavers.

723
01:11:53.309 --> 01:11:55.653
I can also see the soldiers
in the next room...

724
01:11:55.878 --> 01:11:58.188
...preparing that tranquilizing agent
of yours.

725
01:11:58.447 --> 01:11:59.892
You won't need it.

726
01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:03.187
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions.

727
01:12:03.452 --> 01:12:05.864
You could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

728
01:12:06.122 --> 01:12:07.567
Been here for 33 years, doctor.

729
01:12:07.824 --> 01:12:11.738
- Haven't infected anyone yet.
- That you know of. We have legitimate...

730
01:12:11.994 --> 01:12:15.373
...security concerns. You revealed
your identity to Miss Lane over there.

731
01:12:16.365 --> 01:12:18.572
Why won't you do the same with us?

732
01:12:19.535 --> 01:12:21.879
Let's put our cards on the table here,
general.

733
01:12:23.339 --> 01:12:25.046
You're scared because you can't control me.

734
01:12:25.641 --> 01:12:28.178
You don't, and you never will.

735
01:12:29.011 --> 01:12:30.991
But that doesn' mean I'm your enemy.

736
01:12:31.214 --> 01:12:32.716
Then who is'?

737
01:12:32.982 --> 01:12:34.393
Zod'?

738
01:12:35.017 --> 01:12:36.428
That's what I'm worried about.

739
01:12:37.019 --> 01:12:38.726
Be that as it may...

740
01:12:38.988 --> 01:12:41.764
...I've been given orders
to hand you over to him.

741
01:12:42.992 --> 01:12:44.869
Do what you have to do, general.

742
01:12:49.665 --> 01:12:50.439
Thank you.

743
01:12:51.567 --> 01:12:52.545
For what?

744
01:12:53.703 --> 01:12:55.273
For believing in me.

745
01:12:58.341 --> 01:13:00.378
Didn't make much difference in the end.

746
01:13:01.210 --> 01:13:02.746
It did to me.

747
01:13:23.366 --> 01:13:24.902
They're coming.

748
01:13:25.701 --> 01:13:27.203
You should leave now.

749
01:13:30.306 --> 01:13:31.876
Go, Lois.

750
01:14:42.778 --> 01:14:44.155
Kai-El.

751
01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:46.717
I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.

752
01:14:47.383 --> 01:14:50.660
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

753
01:14:56.692 --> 01:14:59.798
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

754
01:15:00.029 --> 01:15:02.009
General Zod would like this woman...

755
01:15:02.231 --> 01:15:03.869
...to accompany me.

756
01:15:04.834 --> 01:15:05.972
You asked for the alien.

757
01:15:07.403 --> 01:15:10.350
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

758
01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:13.713
Shall I tell the general
you're unwilling to comply?

759
01:15:13.976 --> 01:15:15.853
I don't care what you tell him.

760
01:15:18.848 --> 01:15:20.259
It's all right.

761
01:15:21.350 --> 01:15:22.556
I'll go.

762
01:16:05.394 --> 01:16:09.240
The atmospheric composition on our ship
is not compatible with humans.

763
01:16:09.465 --> 01:16:10.876
You need to wear a breather...

764
01:16:11.100 --> 01:16:12.773
...beyond this point.

765
01:16:37.927 --> 01:16:38.837
Kai-El.

766
01:16:40.796 --> 01:16:42.434
You have no idea how long...

767
01:16:42.665 --> 01:16:44.736
...we've been searching for you.

768
01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:46.168
I take it you're Zod?

769
01:16:46.435 --> 01:16:47.573
General Zod.

770
01:16:47.803 --> 01:16:49.612
- Our commander.
- it's all right, Faora.

771
01:16:49.839 --> 01:16:52.513
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

772
01:16:52.775 --> 01:16:54.686
He's a stranger to our ways.

773
01:16:54.944 --> 01:16:55.979
This should be cause...

774
01:16:56.245 --> 01:16:59.283
...for celebration, not conflict.

775
01:16:59.515 --> 01:17:01.688
- Unh.
- Not conflict.

776
01:17:04.120 --> 01:17:05.155
I...

777
01:17:05.421 --> 01:17:06.627
...feel strange.

778
01:17:09.358 --> 01:17:10.666
Weak.

779
01:17:12.862 --> 01:17:14.000
What's happening to him?

780
01:17:14.263 --> 01:17:16.800
He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics.

781
01:17:17.032 --> 01:17:17.635
Clark.

782
01:17:17.867 --> 01:17:20.541
You've spent a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology...

783
01:17:20.703 --> 01:17:21.647
...but never adapted to ours.

784
01:17:21.804 --> 01:17:22.839
Help him.

785
01:17:23.105 --> 01:17:24.641
I can't. Whatever's happening...

786
01:17:24.874 --> 01:17:27.115
- ...has to run its course.
- Clark.

787
01:17:28.477 --> 01:17:29.785
Help him.

788
01:17:31.547 --> 01:17:32.719
Help him.

789
01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:45.896
Hello, Kal.

790
01:17:47.563 --> 01:17:48.633
Or do you prefer Clark?

791
01:17:50.366 --> 01:17:51.743
That's the name they gave you.

792
01:17:52.001 --> 01:17:53.309
Isn't it?

793
01:17:54.570 --> 01:17:56.311
I was Krypton's military leader...

794
01:17:56.539 --> 01:17:58.985
...your father our foremost scientist.

795
01:17:59.208 --> 01:18:00.653
The only thing we agreed on...

796
01:18:00.876 --> 01:18:03.652
...was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts...

797
01:18:03.879 --> 01:18:06.416
...to protect our civilization...

798
01:18:06.682 --> 01:18:08.753
...and save our planet...

799
01:18:09.018 --> 01:18:13.023
...I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

800
01:18:15.991 --> 01:18:19.234
And then the destruction of our world...

801
01:18:19.495 --> 01:18:20.997
...freed us.

802
01:18:26.168 --> 01:18:29.672
We were adrift, destined to ï¬‚oat...

803
01:18:29.905 --> 01:18:31.851
"amongst the ruins of our planet...

804
01:18:32.074 --> 01:18:33.951
...until we starved.

805
01:18:34.843 --> 01:18:36.447
How did you find your way to Earth?

806
01:18:37.213 --> 01:18:41.218
We managed to retrofit
the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.

807
01:18:41.717 --> 01:18:44.891
Your father made a similar modification
to the craft that brought you here.

808
01:18:46.922 --> 01:18:50.028
And so the instrument of our damnation...

809
01:18:52.061 --> 01:18:53.870
...became our salvation.

810
01:18:58.801 --> 01:19:01.304
We sought out the old colonial outposts...

811
01:19:01.570 --> 01:19:03.777
...looking for signs of life.

812
01:19:06.242 --> 01:19:09.052
But all we found was death.

813
01:19:10.045 --> 01:19:12.616
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts...

814
01:19:12.881 --> 01:19:15.088
mwithered and died long ago.

815
01:19:15.584 --> 01:19:17.564
We salvaged what we could...

816
01:19:17.786 --> 01:19:19.493
...3!'H? Of', â€œweapons...

817
01:19:19.755 --> 01:19:21.666
...even a world engine.

818
01:19:23.425 --> 01:19:25.302
For 33 years we prepared...

819
01:19:26.795 --> 01:19:29.571
...until finally we detected
a distress beacon...

820
01:19:29.798 --> 01:19:31.607
...which you triggered...

821
01:19:31.834 --> 01:19:34.075
...when you accessed
the ancient scout ship.

822
01:19:35.471 --> 01:19:38.008
You led us here, Kal.

823
01:19:39.141 --> 01:19:40.484
Now it's within your power...

824
01:19:40.743 --> 01:19:44.350
...to save what remains of your race.

825
01:19:49.118 --> 01:19:50.358
On Krypton...

826
01:19:50.619 --> 01:19:53.259
...the genetic template
for every being yet to be born...

827
01:19:53.489 --> 01:19:56.026
...is encoded in the registry of citizens.

828
01:19:56.692 --> 01:19:58.831
Your father stole the registry's Codex...

829
01:19:59.094 --> 01:20:01.938
...and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

830
01:20:02.631 --> 01:20:03.473
For what purpose?

831
01:20:04.533 --> 01:20:07.275
So that Krypton can live again...

832
01:20:08.137 --> 01:20:09.673
...on Earth.

833
01:20:29.525 --> 01:20:31.630
Where is the Codex, Kal?

834
01:20:33.295 --> 01:20:35.138
If Krypton lives again...

835
01:20:36.298 --> 01:20:37.675
...what happens to Earth?

836
01:20:38.701 --> 01:20:42.205
The foundation has to be
built on something.

837
01:20:42.471 --> 01:20:45.247
Even your father recognized that.

838
01:20:51.714 --> 01:20:54.024
No, Zod.

839
01:20:55.184 --> 01:20:56.390
I can't be a part of this.

840
01:20:57.219 --> 01:20:58.926
Then what can you be a part of?

841
01:20:59.521 --> 01:21:00.727
No!

842
01:21:01.924 --> 01:21:02.527
Zod!

843
01:21:04.026 --> 01:21:04.731
No!

844
01:21:05.894 --> 01:21:07.532
No!

845
01:21:13.569 --> 01:21:14.707
Your father acquitted...

846
01:21:14.937 --> 01:21:16.939
...himself with honor, Kal.

847
01:21:19.842 --> 01:21:21.788
You killed him?

848
01:21:22.177 --> 01:21:23.520
I did.

849
01:21:24.113 --> 01:21:27.526
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

850
01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:31.228
But if I had to do it again, I would.

851
01:21:31.453 --> 01:21:34.923
I have a duty to my people...

852
01:21:35.190 --> 01:21:39.195
...and I will not allow anyone
to prevent me from carrying it out.

853
01:21:55.644 --> 01:21:57.282
What's the sit-rep, major?

854
01:21:57.913 --> 01:22:00.291
DSP pinged two bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

855
01:22:00.549 --> 01:22:02.654
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

856
01:22:03.085 --> 01:22:04.155
There it is.

857
01:22:04.420 --> 01:22:05.228
Re-task lkon-4...

858
01:22:05.454 --> 01:22:07.900
- ...and get me a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

859
01:22:08.223 --> 01:22:09.133
Command, the word...

860
01:22:09.391 --> 01:22:10.563
...of the day is trident.

861
01:22:10.793 --> 01:22:12.898
We have two alien craft
on aggressive approach.

862
01:22:13.128 --> 01:22:14.766
Ikon-4 coming online.

863
01:22:14.997 --> 01:22:15.805
Air speed?

864
01:22:16.064 --> 01:22:17.475
380 knots, entering Kansas...

865
01:22:17.733 --> 01:22:19.735
...airspace.
Not responding to our hails.

866
01:22:19.968 --> 01:22:22.175
You're wasting your efforts.

867
01:22:23.105 --> 01:22:25.449
The strength you derived
from the Earth's sun...

868
01:22:25.674 --> 01:22:27.779
...has been neutralized aboard our ship.

869
01:22:28.444 --> 01:22:29.582
Here...

870
01:22:29.812 --> 01:22:31.416
...in this environment...

871
01:22:32.181 --> 01:22:33.660
...you are as weak as a human.

872
01:22:36.251 --> 01:22:37.161
Unh!

873
01:22:41.123 --> 01:22:42.261
Unh!

874
01:23:32.207 --> 01:23:34.050
Where did you come from?

875
01:23:34.576 --> 01:23:36.021
The command key, Miss Lane.

876
01:23:36.245 --> 01:23:38.691
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
to the ship's mainframe.

877
01:23:39.915 --> 01:23:40.893
Who are you?

878
01:23:41.850 --> 01:23:43.158
I am Kai's father.

879
01:23:44.820 --> 01:23:45.560
Can you help us?

880
01:23:47.523 --> 01:23:49.366
I designed this ship.

881
01:23:49.591 --> 01:23:51.764
I can modify its atmospheric composition...

882
01:23:52.027 --> 01:23:53.768
...to human compatibility.

883
01:23:54.029 --> 01:23:54.871
We can stop them.

884
01:23:55.097 --> 01:23:57.577
We can send them back
to the Phantom Zone.

885
01:23:58.534 --> 01:23:59.171
How?

886
01:23:59.401 --> 01:24:00.937
I can teach you.

887
01:24:01.203 --> 01:24:03.012
And in turn, you can teach Kal.

888
01:24:03.238 --> 01:24:04.945
Will you help me?

889
01:24:18.787 --> 01:24:20.095
The ship's crew are alerted.

890
01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:21.390
We need to move quickly.

891
01:24:21.623 --> 01:24:23.296
Retrieve the command key.

892
01:24:30.933 --> 01:24:33.971
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up her sidearm.

893
01:24:43.378 --> 01:24:44.755
What's happening?

894
01:25:05.734 --> 01:25:06.405
To your right.

895
01:25:06.635 --> 01:25:07.272
Fire.

896
01:25:08.837 --> 01:25:09.577
Behind you.

897
01:25:23.085 --> 01:25:25.122
Secure yourself inside the open pod.

898
01:25:26.154 --> 01:25:28.430
Safe travels, Miss Lane. It's unlikely...

899
01:25:28.657 --> 01:25:30.261
...we'll see each other again.

900
01:25:31.827 --> 01:25:34.933
Remember, the phantom drives
are essential in stopping them.

901
01:25:35.797 --> 01:25:37.037
Move your head to the left.

902
01:26:04.626 --> 01:26:06.537
Is it true what Zod said about the Codex?

903
01:26:07.663 --> 01:26:09.040
Strike that panel.

904
01:26:12.701 --> 01:26:13.873
We wanted you to learn...

905
01:26:14.136 --> 01:26:16.241
...what it meant to be human first...

906
01:26:16.872 --> 01:26:20.513
...so that one day, when the time was right,
you could be the bridge...

907
01:26:20.742 --> 01:26:22.517
...between two peoples.

908
01:26:25.247 --> 01:26:26.021
Look.

909
01:26:29.184 --> 01:26:30.424
Lois.

910
01:26:31.019 --> 01:26:32.054
You can save her, Kal.

911
01:26:35.190 --> 01:26:37.067
You can save all of them.

912
01:27:55.971 --> 01:27:57.507
You'll be safe here.

913
01:27:59.841 --> 01:28:02.412
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

914
01:28:05.647 --> 01:28:07.126
I'm sorry.

915
01:28:07.849 --> 01:28:10.830
I didn't wanna tell them anything,
but they did something to me.

916
01:28:11.086 --> 01:28:13.259
- They looked inside my mind--
- it's okay, Lois.

917
01:28:13.488 --> 01:28:15.263
They did the same thing to me.

918
01:28:28.336 --> 01:28:29.679
Clark!

919
01:28:38.680 --> 01:28:40.455
The craft he arrived in...

920
01:28:40.982 --> 01:28:42.154
...where is it?

921
01:28:44.052 --> 01:28:45.224
Go to hell.

922
01:28:56.531 --> 01:28:57.509
There.

923
01:28:58.900 --> 01:28:59.571
Unh!

924
01:29:20.522 --> 01:29:22.661
The Codex is not here.

925
01:29:23.758 --> 01:29:25.032
Argh!

926
01:29:26.094 --> 01:29:27.596
Ah!

927
01:29:29.397 --> 01:29:30.432
Where has he hidden it?

928
01:29:30.699 --> 01:29:31.336
I don't know.

929
01:29:31.566 --> 01:29:32.670
Where is the Codex?!

930
01:29:36.705 --> 01:29:38.048
Ahh!

931
01:29:48.683 --> 01:29:50.629
You think you can threaten my mother?!

932
01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:57.225
Ah!

933
01:30:32.427 --> 01:30:33.906
What have you done to me?

934
01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:36.575
My parents taught me to hone...

935
01:30:36.798 --> 01:30:38.277
...my senses, Zod.

936
01:30:39.968 --> 01:30:41.572
Focus...

937
01:30:42.137 --> 01:30:43.844
...on just what I wanted to see.

938
01:30:44.105 --> 01:30:45.140
Without your helmet...

939
01:30:45.407 --> 01:30:46.977
...you're getting everything.

940
01:30:47.175 --> 01:30:48.085
Unh!

941
01:30:48.243 --> 01:30:49.654
And it hurts...

942
01:30:50.245 --> 01:30:51.622
...doesn't it?

943
01:31:02.490 --> 01:31:03.992
Argh!

944
01:31:36.458 --> 01:31:37.732
Get away from the window.

945
01:31:40.695 --> 01:31:42.504
Get inside. It's not safe.

946
01:31:47.836 --> 01:31:50.715
Ail players, this is
Guardian. I am airborne mission commander.

947
01:31:50.972 --> 01:31:53.009
I have previously encountered
and observed...

948
01:31:53.241 --> 01:31:55.380
...the beings we're about to engage.

949
01:31:55.643 --> 01:31:58.351
They are extremely dangerous
and we have been authorized...

950
01:31:58.580 --> 01:32:00.082
...to use deadly force.

951
01:32:02.050 --> 01:32:04.030
Roger, Guardian, we are inbound to target.

952
01:32:09.691 --> 01:32:10.897
Cleared hot. Weapons free.

953
01:32:11.159 --> 01:32:12.763
Copy, 11. Weapons free.

954
01:32:15.563 --> 01:32:16.337
Thunder 11...

955
01:32:16.564 --> 01:32:17.599
...tally three targets.

956
01:32:29.077 --> 01:32:30.112
Unh!

957
01:32:35.216 --> 01:32:36.024
Thunder 11...

958
01:32:36.251 --> 01:32:38.697
...good hit.
Request immediate re-attack.

959
01:32:38.920 --> 01:32:41.059
Roger, Guardian.
We'll make a second gun run...

960
01:32:41.289 --> 01:32:43.394
...on a heading of 212 degrees.

961
01:32:50.398 --> 01:32:51.376
Thunder 11, eject!

962
01:32:51.599 --> 01:32:52.976
Eject!

963
01:32:53.301 --> 01:32:54.939
Thunder 11, eject!

964
01:33:05.080 --> 01:33:06.650
I have a bogey incoming!

965
01:33:07.482 --> 01:33:08.927
Oh, shit.

966
01:33:23.832 --> 01:33:24.572
Argh!

967
01:33:27.102 --> 01:33:27.978
You are weak...

968
01:33:28.236 --> 01:33:29.340
...son of El.

969
01:33:29.604 --> 01:33:30.742
Unsure of yourself.

970
01:33:35.977 --> 01:33:38.958
The fact that you possess
a sense of morality...

971
01:33:39.180 --> 01:33:40.955
...and we do not...

972
01:33:41.182 --> 01:33:43.753
...gives us an evolutionary advantage.

973
01:33:47.255 --> 01:33:49.758
And if history has proven anything...

974
01:33:59.634 --> 01:34:03.207
...it is that evolution always wins.

975
01:34:04.873 --> 01:34:05.544
Ragh!

976
01:34:10.311 --> 01:34:11.483
Unh!

977
01:34:24.526 --> 01:34:26.028
CCT, we're approaching...

978
01:34:26.294 --> 01:34:28.137
...LZ Jayhawk. Get down in five.

979
01:34:28.363 --> 01:34:30.206
Let's go. Go to the LZ.

980
01:34:30.999 --> 01:34:32.171
Roger, sarge. let's go!

981
01:35:09.771 --> 01:35:11.079
All rangers, I need you...

982
01:35:11.339 --> 01:35:12.511
...to engage the targets.

983
01:35:13.007 --> 01:35:14.077
Guardian, this is Badger 01.

984
01:35:14.342 --> 01:35:15.616
What about the guy in blue?

985
01:35:15.877 --> 01:35:16.912
I said engage...

986
01:35:17.178 --> 01:35:18.350
...all targets.

987
01:35:29.524 --> 01:35:30.559
Contact. Contact.

988
01:35:34.929 --> 01:35:35.805
Ah!

989
01:35:40.735 --> 01:35:41.577
You Okay?

990
01:35:47.308 --> 01:35:49.413
We're auto-rotating, going in hard.

991
01:35:50.144 --> 01:35:51.316
Brace for impact.

992
01:35:52.113 --> 01:35:53.251
Brace for impact.

993
01:35:53.481 --> 01:35:54.459
We're going in hard!

994
01:35:59.554 --> 01:36:03.559
Fallen angel. Fallen angel.
Guardian is down. I repeat, Guardian is down.

995
01:36:25.480 --> 01:36:26.982
Guardian, do you read?

996
01:36:27.248 --> 01:36:28.591
Thunder 12, calling Guardian.

997
01:36:28.816 --> 01:36:30.159
- Do you read?
- Thunder 12...

998
01:36:30.418 --> 01:36:31.328
...this is Guardian.

999
01:36:31.586 --> 01:36:33.964
Put down everything you've got
north of my position.

1000
01:36:34.188 --> 01:36:36.361
- This will be danger-close.
- Copy, danger-close.

1001
01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:37.864
Good luck, sir.

1002
01:37:17.732 --> 01:37:20.576
A good death is its own reward.

1003
01:37:34.182 --> 01:37:35.559
You will not win.

1004
01:37:36.984 --> 01:37:38.520
For every human you save...

1005
01:37:38.753 --> 01:37:41.427
...we will kill a million more. Unh!

1006
01:38:32.740 --> 01:38:35.914
Do we have an all clear?
Do we have an all clear?

1007
01:38:36.144 --> 01:38:38.420
Alpha team, sit-rep. Alpha team.

1008
01:38:38.646 --> 01:38:40.250
Do you copy? Alpha team.

1009
01:39:29.764 --> 01:39:31.971
This man is not our enemy.

1010
01:39:34.435 --> 01:39:35.971
Thank you, colonel.

1011
01:39:53.821 --> 01:39:54.663
Mom'?

1012
01:39:55.957 --> 01:39:57.630
I'm all right.

1013
01:40:09.670 --> 01:40:11.650
Nice suit, son.

1014
01:40:12.707 --> 01:40:14.015
I'm so sorry.

1015
01:40:15.042 --> 01:40:17.352
It's only stuff, Clark.

1016
01:40:18.513 --> 01:40:20.925
It can always be replaced.

1017
01:40:23.384 --> 01:40:24.658
But you can't be.

1018
01:40:25.987 --> 01:40:28.399
Mom, Zod said this Codex...

1019
01:40:28.656 --> 01:40:30.932
...he's looking for can
bring my people back.

1020
01:40:31.259 --> 01:40:32.932
Isn't that a good thing?

1021
01:40:37.164 --> 01:40:39.667
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

1022
01:40:40.268 --> 01:40:41.508
Clark.

1023
01:40:42.236 --> 01:40:43.112
Clark.

1024
01:40:45.006 --> 01:40:46.883
I know how to stop them.

1025
01:40:48.943 --> 01:40:50.388
What happened down there?

1026
01:40:50.611 --> 01:40:53.455
He exposed a temporary weakness.

1027
01:40:54.348 --> 01:40:56.191
It is of little consequence...

1028
01:40:57.552 --> 01:41:00.465
...because I have located the Codex.

1029
01:41:01.255 --> 01:41:03.531
It was never in the capsule.

1030
01:41:04.125 --> 01:41:05.798
<i>Jor-el took the Codex---</i>

1031
01:41:06.060 --> 01:41:08.540
...the DNA of a billion people,
then he bonded it...

1032
01:41:08.763 --> 01:41:10.572
...within his son's individual...

1033
01:41:10.798 --> 01:41:11.742
cells.

1034
01:41:11.966 --> 01:41:13.570
All of Krypton's heirs...

1035
01:41:13.801 --> 01:41:17.248
...living hidden in one refugee's body.

1036
01:41:21.309 --> 01:41:23.289
Does Kal-EI need to be alive...

1037
01:41:23.544 --> 01:41:26.718
...for us to extract the Codex from his cells?

1038
01:41:28.082 --> 01:41:29.254
No.

1039
01:41:35.156 --> 01:41:37.432
Release the world engine.

1040
01:42:09.657 --> 01:42:10.601
â€œMat just happened?

1041
01:42:10.758 --> 01:42:11.930
The ship just split in mo.

1042
01:42:12.159 --> 01:42:15.265
Track one is heading east,
track two to the southern hemisphere.

1043
01:42:15.496 --> 01:42:17.942
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching...

1044
01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:19.610
...Mach 24 and accelerating.

1045
01:42:19.834 --> 01:42:22.508
It's gonna impact
somewhere in the Indian Ocean.

1046
01:42:41.222 --> 01:42:42.860
The rest of the ship is descending.

1047
01:42:43.858 --> 01:42:44.996
Put it on the board now.

1048
01:42:45.226 --> 01:42:46.296
Yes, sir.

1049
01:42:47.328 --> 01:42:48.500
Oh, my God.

1050
01:43:29.003 --> 01:43:31.779
Bring the phantom drive online.

1051
01:43:53.394 --> 01:43:55.237
We are now slave to the world engine.

1052
01:43:56.964 --> 01:43:58.375
Initiate.

1053
01:44:32.433 --> 01:44:35.846
- What have they hit us with?
- Looks like some kind of gravity...

1054
01:44:36.103 --> 01:44:38.640
...weapon.
It's working in tandem with their ship.

1055
01:44:40.074 --> 01:44:43.146
Somehow they're increasing
the Earth's mass...

1056
01:44:43.410 --> 01:44:45.515
...clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

1057
01:44:47.248 --> 01:44:48.852
Oh, my God.

1058
01:44:50.184 --> 01:44:51.185
They're terraforming.

1059
01:44:51.952 --> 01:44:52.760
What's that?

1060
01:44:53.587 --> 01:44:54.691
Planetary engineering...

1061
01:44:54.955 --> 01:44:58.164
...modifying the Earth's atmosphere
and topography.

1062
01:44:58.425 --> 01:44:59.665
Turning Earth into Krypton.

1063
01:45:00.361 --> 01:45:03.501
- But what happens to us?
- Based on these readings...

1064
01:45:03.764 --> 01:45:06.768
...there won't be an "us."
General Swanwick, sir.

1065
01:45:07.168 --> 01:45:08.545
I'm on with the control tower.

1066
01:45:08.803 --> 01:45:11.044
Colonel Hardy's on his way
and he's got Superman in tow.

1067
01:45:11.772 --> 01:45:12.842
Superman?

1068
01:45:13.374 --> 01:45:14.546
The alien, sir.

1069
01:45:14.809 --> 01:45:17.187
That's what they're calling him.
Superman.

1070
01:45:22.683 --> 01:45:23.889
We have a plan, general.

1071
01:45:24.151 --> 01:45:25.630
Is that what I think it is?

1072
01:45:26.787 --> 01:45:28.562
It's the ship he arrived in.

1073
01:45:30.224 --> 01:45:32.864
This ship is powered by something
called a phantom drive.

1074
01:45:33.127 --> 01:45:34.572
It bends space.

1075
01:45:34.829 --> 01:45:38.800
Zod's ship uses the same technology,
and if we can make the two drives collide--

1076
01:45:39.033 --> 01:45:40.876
A singularity can be created.

1077
01:45:41.135 --> 01:45:42.170
- Like a black hole.
- Yes.

1078
01:45:42.703 --> 01:45:44.205
So if we open up this doorway...

1079
01:45:44.471 --> 01:45:46.075
...they should be pulled back in.

1080
01:45:46.340 --> 01:45:48.843
So you want us to bomb them with that?

1081
01:45:49.076 --> 01:45:51.056
General, that craft maxes out...

1082
01:45:51.312 --> 01:45:54.691
...17,000 pounds,
we can drop it from a C-17.

1083
01:45:54.915 --> 01:45:56.053
It's a viable plan.

1084
01:45:56.317 --> 01:45:58.422
If I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean...

1085
01:45:58.686 --> 01:46:00.393
...the gravity field will continue...

1086
01:46:00.654 --> 01:46:01.997
...to expand.

1087
01:46:07.761 --> 01:46:10.537
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton...

1088
01:46:10.898 --> 01:46:12.434
...won't you be weaker around it?

1089
01:46:14.235 --> 01:46:15.543
Maybe.

1090
01:46:16.403 --> 01:46:18.883
I'm not about to let that
stop me from trying.

1091
01:46:19.840 --> 01:46:22.047
You might want to step back a little bit.

1092
01:46:24.111 --> 01:46:25.249
Maybe a little bit more.

1093
01:46:57.711 --> 01:46:58.314
Faora.

1094
01:46:59.313 --> 01:47:00.417
Take command.

1095
01:47:00.648 --> 01:47:03.788
- Yes, sir.
- I need to secure the genesis chamber...

1096
01:47:04.218 --> 01:47:06.960
...and pay my respects to an old friend.

1097
01:47:14.728 --> 01:47:16.833
Guardian en route to Metropolis...

1098
01:47:17.631 --> 01:47:18.837
...package in tow.

1099
01:47:24.104 --> 01:47:27.017
Be advised,
F-35s inbound to rendezvous point.

1100
01:47:27.274 --> 01:47:29.447
You should have visual contact now.

1101
01:48:14.455 --> 01:48:18.130
Command key accepted.
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.

1102
01:48:18.525 --> 01:48:19.469
Stop this, Zod...

1103
01:48:19.693 --> 01:48:21.832
...while there's still time.

1104
01:48:23.063 --> 01:48:26.374
Haven't given up lecturing me,
have you, even in death?

1105
01:48:26.734 --> 01:48:28.736
I will not let you use the Codex like this.

1106
01:48:29.003 --> 01:48:30.710
You don't have the power to stop me.

1107
01:48:30.971 --> 01:48:34.009
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority.

1108
01:48:34.241 --> 01:48:37.154
This ship is now under my control.

1109
01:49:08.675 --> 01:49:10.245
Norlhcom, Lightning 1, request...

1110
01:49:10.511 --> 01:49:12.923
- ...permission to unleash the hounds.
- Lightning 1...

1111
01:49:13.180 --> 01:49:16.627
...you are clear to engage. Send battle
damage assessment when able. Out.

1112
01:49:30.197 --> 01:49:32.575
Avionics are going haywire.
The gravity field...

1113
01:49:32.800 --> 01:49:35.144
...is pulling our missiles down.
We gotta get closer.

1114
01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.275
All right, everybody...

1115
01:49:41.542 --> 01:49:44.421
...we're leaving.
We're leaving the building now.

1116
01:50:07.568 --> 01:50:09.445
I just lost my wingman.

1117
01:50:11.805 --> 01:50:12.943
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

1118
01:50:24.518 --> 01:50:26.498
Everybody, this way! Come on!

1119
01:50:26.753 --> 01:50:29.825
Everybody, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving.

1120
01:50:36.663 --> 01:50:37.698
Jenny!

1121
01:50:41.668 --> 01:50:42.510
Oh, my God.

1122
01:50:42.769 --> 01:50:43.770
Perry!

1123
01:50:48.208 --> 01:50:50.154
Go! There! Go!

1124
01:50:56.016 --> 01:50:57.518
Our people can co-exist.

1125
01:50:58.152 --> 01:51:02.157
So we can suffer through years of pain
trying to adapt like your son has?

1126
01:51:02.990 --> 01:51:04.663
- You're talking about genocide.
- Yes.

1127
01:51:04.892 --> 01:51:07.498
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.

1128
01:51:08.862 --> 01:51:10.671
We're both ghosts, Zod.

1129
01:51:10.898 --> 01:51:14.402
Can't you see that?
The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone.

1130
01:51:14.668 --> 01:51:17.239
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

1131
01:51:17.504 --> 01:51:18.380
- You'll fail.
- I have.

1132
01:51:18.639 --> 01:51:20.050
Then prepare to terminate it.

1133
01:51:20.307 --> 01:51:22.082
- I'm tired of this debate.
Silencing me...

1134
01:51:22.342 --> 01:51:23.753
...won't change anything.

1135
01:51:26.013 --> 01:51:27.321
My son...

1136
01:51:28.148 --> 01:51:29.491
...is twice the man you were.

1137
01:51:32.486 --> 01:51:34.159
And he will finish what we started.

1138
01:51:35.088 --> 01:51:36.328
I can promise you that.

1139
01:51:41.528 --> 01:51:42.905
Tell me...

1140
01:51:43.163 --> 01:51:46.736
...you have Jor-El's memories,
his conscience.

1141
01:51:47.434 --> 01:51:48.435
Can you experience...

1142
01:51:48.702 --> 01:51:49.840
...his pain?

1143
01:51:51.872 --> 01:51:55.445
I will harvest the Codex
from your son's corpse...

1144
01:51:55.909 --> 01:51:58.219
...and I will rebuild Krypton...

1145
01:51:58.445 --> 01:52:00.948
..atop his bones.

1146
01:52:29.276 --> 01:52:30.584
Argh!

1147
01:52:58.639 --> 01:52:59.344
Jenny.

1148
01:52:59.606 --> 01:53:02.348
- Jenny. Jenny, where are you?
- I'm here!

1149
01:53:02.609 --> 01:53:03.644
- I'm here. Here.
- Jenny.

1150
01:53:03.910 --> 01:53:05.412
Hold on, hold on.

1151
01:53:05.646 --> 01:53:06.624
I'm stuck.

1152
01:53:06.847 --> 01:53:08.520
- I can't get free. I'm stuck.
- Okay.

1153
01:53:08.782 --> 01:53:11.319
We'll get you out of there, all right?
Just sit tight.

1154
01:53:11.585 --> 01:53:12.154
No, no, no!

1155
01:53:12.419 --> 01:53:14.126
- Don't leave me.
- We're not gonna leave you.

1156
01:53:14.354 --> 01:53:15.526
- Okay.
- Lombard!

1157
01:53:15.789 --> 01:53:19.134
- Get your ass over here and help me.
- Damn it.

1158
01:53:21.128 --> 01:53:23.108
- We just gotta move this.
- Here.

1159
01:53:23.330 --> 01:53:25.367
Slide that in. You push, I'll pull, okay?

1160
01:53:25.632 --> 01:53:26.667
Go.

1161
01:53:30.871 --> 01:53:32.179
- Push!
- Oh, my God.

1162
01:53:32.439 --> 01:53:34.043
It's getting closer! Come on, push!

1163
01:53:36.109 --> 01:53:38.316
Northcom, this is Guardian.
Are we cleared?

1164
01:53:38.845 --> 01:53:39.846
Negative, Guardian.

1165
01:54:04.571 --> 01:54:07.017
Come on! Push!

1166
01:54:07.207 --> 01:54:08.208
Ahh!

1167
01:54:33.200 --> 01:54:35.180
Argh!

1168
01:54:59.025 --> 01:55:00.368
He did it.

1169
01:55:02.562 --> 01:55:03.802
Northcom, this is Guardian.

1170
01:55:04.064 --> 01:55:06.305
We're passing through phase line red.
Good to go.

1171
01:55:06.566 --> 01:55:07.476
Godspeed, Guardian.

1172
01:55:07.734 --> 01:55:10.146
Arm the package. You are cleared hot.

1173
01:55:10.404 --> 01:55:12.475
We're lining up for the final run.

1174
01:55:13.273 --> 01:55:15.275
It's up to you and Hamilton now.

1175
01:55:55.449 --> 01:55:56.189
You gotta be kidding me.

1176
01:55:56.450 --> 01:55:57.861
Loadmaster, is the package...

1177
01:55:58.118 --> 01:55:59.119
...ready to drop?

1178
01:55:59.352 --> 01:56:00.626
Negative, Guardian.

1179
01:56:00.854 --> 01:56:02.424
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.

1180
01:56:02.656 --> 01:56:04.431
What's it supposed to do?

1181
01:56:04.658 --> 01:56:07.696
- It's supposed to go in all the way.
- Let me take a look.

1182
01:56:07.961 --> 01:56:09.531
'Se-pilot's aircraft.

1183
01:56:10.263 --> 01:56:11.765
Sea-pilot's aircraft.

1184
01:56:18.505 --> 01:56:21.179
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?

1185
01:56:21.441 --> 01:56:22.442
We've had a setback.

1186
01:56:38.191 --> 01:56:39.693
Target that aircraft.

1187
01:56:43.563 --> 01:56:45.008
Target locked.

1188
01:56:54.808 --> 01:56:55.684
Stop!

1189
01:56:55.909 --> 01:56:58.014
If you destroy this ship...

1190
01:56:58.245 --> 01:57:00.919
...you destroy Krypton!

1191
01:57:03.717 --> 01:57:05.890
Krypton had its chance.

1192
01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:09.195
Argh!

1193
01:57:59.873 --> 01:58:01.750
Miss Lane! It's not safe for you...

1194
01:58:01.975 --> 01:58:02.885
...over there!

1195
01:58:03.109 --> 01:58:03.712
Miss Lane!

1196
01:58:05.312 --> 01:58:06.552
Ah!

1197
01:58:33.607 --> 01:58:35.348
Move now! Go!

1198
01:58:56.196 --> 01:58:57.197
A good death...

1199
01:58:57.464 --> 01:58:59.034
...is its own reward.

1200
01:59:06.640 --> 01:59:08.017
Ah!

1201
01:59:29.562 --> 01:59:30.632
Ah!

1202
01:59:47.414 --> 01:59:48.825
Argh!

1203
02:00:01.494 --> 02:00:02.939
Are they gone?

1204
02:00:04.097 --> 02:00:05.508
I think so.

1205
02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:08.743
He saved us.

1206
02:00:34.227 --> 02:00:37.436
You know, they say it's all downhill
after the first kiss.

1207
02:00:40.900 --> 02:00:43.938
I'm pretty sure that only counts
when you're kissing a human.

1208
02:01:13.299 --> 02:01:14.778
Look at this.

1209
02:01:17.070 --> 02:01:18.981
We could have built a new Krypton...

1210
02:01:19.239 --> 02:01:20.980
...in this squalor.

1211
02:01:21.241 --> 02:01:24.347
But you chose the humans over us.

1212
02:01:25.779 --> 02:01:27.315
I exist...

1213
02:01:27.580 --> 02:01:29.992
...only to protect Krypton.

1214
02:01:31.751 --> 02:01:35.756
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born.

1215
02:01:36.990 --> 02:01:39.129
And every action I take...

1216
02:01:39.359 --> 02:01:41.361
...no matter how violent...

1217
02:01:41.628 --> 02:01:43.335
...or how cruel...

1218
02:01:44.531 --> 02:01:46.943
...is for the greater good...

1219
02:01:47.167 --> 02:01:49.113
...of my people.

1220
02:01:53.439 --> 02:01:54.850
And now...

1221
02:01:55.108 --> 02:01:57.384
...I have no people.

1222
02:02:00.814 --> 02:02:02.384
My soul...

1223
02:02:04.484 --> 02:02:08.022
...that is what you have taken...

1224
02:02:08.288 --> 02:02:09.892
...from me.

1225
02:02:16.796 --> 02:02:19.299
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.

1226
02:02:19.532 --> 02:02:22.979
These humans you've adopted,
I will take them all from you...

1227
02:02:23.203 --> 02:02:26.184
...one by one.
- You're a monster, Zod...

1228
02:02:28.808 --> 02:02:30.014
...and I'm gonna stop you.

1229
02:02:42.488 --> 02:02:43.694
Argh!

1230
02:02:51.998 --> 02:02:52.669
Argh!

1231
02:04:11.611 --> 02:04:12.316
There's only...

1232
02:04:12.578 --> 02:04:13.921
...one way this ends, Kal.

1233
02:04:14.147 --> 02:04:15.990
Either you die...

1234
02:04:16.249 --> 02:04:17.023
...or I do.

1235
02:04:38.204 --> 02:04:39.114
Unh!

1236
02:04:48.681 --> 02:04:50.820
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

1237
02:04:51.684 --> 02:04:53.322
Trained my entire life...

1238
02:04:53.553 --> 02:04:55.396
...to master my senses.

1239
02:04:55.888 --> 02:04:59.495
Where did you train? On a farm?

1240
02:06:51.270 --> 02:06:52.908
Argh!

1241
02:07:08.421 --> 02:07:09.866
If you love...

1242
02:07:10.123 --> 02:07:12.467
...these people so much...

1243
02:07:13.192 --> 02:07:15.468
...you can mourn for them.

1244
02:07:19.932 --> 02:07:21.002
Don't do this!

1245
02:07:24.203 --> 02:07:25.011
Stop!

1246
02:07:31.377 --> 02:07:32.355
Stop!

1247
02:07:34.714 --> 02:07:35.852
Never.

1248
02:08:05.845 --> 02:08:07.347
Ahh!

1249
02:09:10.543 --> 02:09:11.920
Are you effing stupid?

1250
02:09:12.144 --> 02:09:13.885
It's one of your surveillance drones.

1251
02:09:14.113 --> 02:09:16.616
That's a $12,000,000 piece of hardware.

1252
02:09:16.782 --> 02:09:17.817
It was.

1253
02:09:18.618 --> 02:09:21.155
I know you're trying to find out
where I hang my cape.

1254
02:09:21.754 --> 02:09:23.233
- You won't.
- Then I'll ask...

1255
02:09:23.456 --> 02:09:24.764
...the obvious question:

1256
02:09:25.224 --> 02:09:28.228
How do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

1257
02:09:28.928 --> 02:09:30.771
I grew up in Kansas, general.

1258
02:09:31.230 --> 02:09:33.403
I'm about as American as it gets.

1259
02:09:33.666 --> 02:09:34.576
Look...

1260
02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:36.279
...I'm hereto help...

1261
02:09:36.502 --> 02:09:38.743
...but it has to be on my own terms.

1262
02:09:38.971 --> 02:09:40.814
You have to convince Washington of that.

1263
02:09:41.073 --> 02:09:45.078
Even if I were willing to try,
what makes you think they'd listen?

1264
02:09:46.145 --> 02:09:47.749
I don't know, general.

1265
02:09:49.148 --> 02:09:50.855
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

1266
02:10:00.426 --> 02:10:01.803
What are you smiling about?

1267
02:10:02.628 --> 02:10:03.971
Nothing, sir.

1268
02:10:07.133 --> 02:10:09.113
I just think he's kind of hot.

1269
02:10:11.270 --> 02:10:13.375
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.

1270
02:10:23.349 --> 02:10:26.558
He always believed
you were meant for greater things.

1271
02:10:26.819 --> 02:10:28.321
And that when the day came...

1272
02:10:28.554 --> 02:10:31.364
...your shoulders would be able
to bear the weight.

1273
02:10:31.624 --> 02:10:35.470
Yeah, I just wish he could have
been here to see it finally happen.

1274
02:10:35.895 --> 02:10:37.875
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1275
02:11:25.378 --> 02:11:28.222
What are you going to do
when you're not saving the world?

1276
02:11:28.447 --> 02:11:32.190
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually. Heh, heh.

1277
02:11:33.786 --> 02:11:37.791
I gotta find a job
where I can keep my ear to the ground.

1278
02:11:43.028 --> 02:11:45.099
Where people won't look twice...

1279
02:11:45.364 --> 02:11:49.141
...when I want to go somewhere dangerous
and start asking questions.

1280
02:12:03.249 --> 02:12:06.287
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?

1281
02:12:07.553 --> 02:12:09.226
Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1282
02:12:09.655 --> 02:12:11.225
- What do you say?
- I say...

1283
02:12:11.457 --> 02:12:13.994
...you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1284
02:12:14.260 --> 02:12:17.639
You'll probably have more luck. Sorry.

1285
02:12:19.432 --> 02:12:20.103
Courtside?

1286
02:12:20.332 --> 02:12:22.073
- Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.

1287
02:12:22.301 --> 02:12:25.111
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1288
02:12:25.337 --> 02:12:28.580
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.

1289
02:12:28.808 --> 02:12:30.116
Good luck, kid.

1290
02:12:31.644 --> 02:12:32.918
Hey. Steve.

1291
02:12:33.145 --> 02:12:34.419
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1292
02:12:34.647 --> 02:12:35.489
Hi.

1293
02:12:36.415 --> 02:12:37.758
Lois Lane.

1294
02:12:38.584 --> 02:12:40.120
Welcome to the Planet.

1295
02:12:43.856 --> 02:12:45.836
Glad to be here, Lois.
