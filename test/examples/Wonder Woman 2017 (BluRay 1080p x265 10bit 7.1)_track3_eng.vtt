00:00:48.842 --> 00:00:51.428
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

2
00:00:53.013 --> 00:00:55.224
<i>This beautiful place.</i>

3
00:00:57.100 --> 00:00:59.102
<i>But I knew so little then.</i>

4
00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:03.774
<i>It is a land of magic and wonder.</i>

5
00:01:04.691 --> 00:01:07.319
<i>Worth cherishing in every way.</i>

6
00:01:09.613 --> 00:01:11.448
<i>But the closer you get,</i>

7
00:01:12.699 --> 00:01:16.286
<i>the more you see the great darkness
simmering within.</i>

8
00:01:20.707 --> 00:01:23.252
<i>And mankind?</i>

9
00:01:24.294 --> 00:01:26.922
<i>Mankind is another story altogether.</i>

10
00:01:29.258 --> 00:01:34.179
<i>What one does when faced with the truth
is more difficult than you think.</i>

11
00:01:44.439 --> 00:01:46.191
<i>I learned this the hard way.</i>

12
00:01:47.484 --> 00:01:49.319
<i>A long, long time ago.</i>

13
00:01:52.197 --> 00:01:53.198
<i>And now,</i>

14
00:01:56.034 --> 00:01:57.703
<i>I will never be the same.</i>

15
00:02:05.377 --> 00:02:06.378
<i>Merci.</i>

16
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.593
Hello, Diana.

17
00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.511
- Hello, Diana.
- Hello.

18
00:02:57.179 --> 00:02:58.472
<i>Diana!</i>

19
00:02:59.514 --> 00:03:00.974
Diana!

20
00:03:01.558 --> 00:03:02.559
<i>Come back!</i>

21
00:03:42.307 --> 00:03:43.809
- It looks very good.
- Very good.

22
00:03:43.975 --> 00:03:44.976
How is she doing?

23
00:03:45.143 --> 00:03:46.144
She's good.

24
00:03:46.311 --> 00:03:47.646
- Keep working with her.
- I will.

25
00:03:48.855 --> 00:03:49.856
Naomi.

26
00:04:12.337 --> 00:04:13.380
Diana!

27
00:04:15.006 --> 00:04:16.341
Diana, I see you.

28
00:04:22.681 --> 00:04:24.724
Where are you going?
Slow down!

29
00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:36.862
Hello, Mother.

30
00:04:37.446 --> 00:04:38.864
How are you today?

31
00:04:40.365 --> 00:04:42.909
<i>Let's get you back to school
before another tutor quits.</i>

32
00:04:43.076 --> 00:04:46.621
But don't you think
it's time to start my training?

33
00:04:47.205 --> 00:04:49.040
Antiope thinks I'm ready.

34
00:04:50.041 --> 00:04:51.042
Does she?

35
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.379
I could begin showing her some things.

36
00:04:56.214 --> 00:04:58.383
She should at least
be able to defend herself.

37
00:04:58.550 --> 00:04:59.593
From whom?

38
00:04:59.759 --> 00:05:01.720
In the event of an invasion.

39
00:05:01.887 --> 00:05:05.223
<i>Isn't that why I have
the greatest warrior in our history</i>

40
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:07.726
leading an entire army, General?

41
00:05:08.894 --> 00:05:11.813
I pray a day will never come
where she has to fight.

42
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:15.066
But you know,
a scorpion must sting,

43
00:05:15.233 --> 00:05:17.819
<i>- a wolf must hunt--</i>
- She is a child.

44
00:05:17.986 --> 00:05:19.946
<i>The only child on the island.
Please let her be so.</i>

45
00:05:20.113 --> 00:05:21.114
<i>But, Mother...</i>

46
00:05:21.281 --> 00:05:22.824
There will be no training.

47
00:05:30.749 --> 00:05:32.209
<i>What if I promised to be careful?</i>

48
00:05:33.335 --> 00:05:34.920
It's time to sleep.

49
00:05:36.713 --> 00:05:39.007
What if I didn't use a sword?

50
00:05:39.591 --> 00:05:41.843
Fighting does not make you a hero.

51
00:05:42.427 --> 00:05:44.763
Just a shield then. No sharp edges.

52
00:05:44.930 --> 00:05:49.100
Diana, you are the most
precious thing in the world to me.

53
00:05:50.185 --> 00:05:53.980
I wished for you so much so,
I sculpted you from clay myself

54
00:05:54.147 --> 00:05:56.691
and begged Zeus to give you life.

55
00:05:56.858 --> 00:05:58.652
You've told me this story.

56
00:05:59.236 --> 00:06:02.656
Which is why tonight
I will tell you a new one.

57
00:06:03.281 --> 00:06:06.451
A story of our people,
and my days of battle.

58
00:06:06.618 --> 00:06:07.619
Yes!

59
00:06:07.786 --> 00:06:11.289
So you will finally understand
why war is nothing to hope for.

60
00:06:17.629 --> 00:06:20.340
Long ago, when time was new

61
00:06:21.007 --> 00:06:23.969
and all of history was still a dream,

62
00:06:24.135 --> 00:06:26.471
<i>the Gods ruled the Earth,</i>

63
00:06:26.638 --> 00:06:29.307
<i>Zeus king among them.</i>

64
00:06:31.851 --> 00:06:35.021
<i>Zeus created beings
over which the Gods would rule.</i>

65
00:06:35.564 --> 00:06:38.066
<i>Beings born in his image,</i>

66
00:06:38.233 --> 00:06:41.903
<i>fair and good,
strong and passionate.</i>

67
00:06:42.821 --> 00:06:46.741
He called his creation "man."
And mankind was good.

68
00:06:47.742 --> 00:06:50.912
But Zeus's son grew envious of mankind

69
00:06:51.079 --> 00:06:54.332
and sought to corrupt
his father's creation.

70
00:06:55.333 --> 00:06:58.837
<i>This was Ares, the God of War.</i>

71
00:07:01.006 --> 00:07:05.218
Ares poisoned men's hearts
with jealousy and suspicion.

72
00:07:05.385 --> 00:07:07.512
<i>He turned them against one another</i>

73
00:07:07.679 --> 00:07:10.682
<i>and war ravaged the Earth.</i>

74
00:07:11.683 --> 00:07:15.729
<i>So, the Gods created us, the Amazons,</i>

75
00:07:15.895 --> 00:07:18.523
<i>to influence men's hearts with love</i>

76
00:07:18.690 --> 00:07:21.192
<i>and restore peace to the Earth.</i>

77
00:07:24.237 --> 00:07:27.365
<i>And for a brief time, there was peace.</i>

78
00:07:33.246 --> 00:07:34.748
<i>But it did not last.</i>

79
00:07:41.421 --> 00:07:45.091
<i>Your mother, the Amazon Queen,
led a revolt</i>

80
00:07:45.258 --> 00:07:48.219
<i>that freed us all from enslavement.</i>

81
00:07:55.310 --> 00:07:58.480
<i>When Zeus led the Gods to our defense,</i>

82
00:07:58.647 --> 00:08:01.900
<i>Ares killed them one by one,</i>

83
00:08:02.067 --> 00:08:05.236
<i>until only Zeus himself remained.</i>

84
00:08:06.571 --> 00:08:10.950
<i>Zeus used the last of his power
to stop Ares,</i>

85
00:08:11.785 --> 00:08:16.581
<i>striking such a blow,
the God of War was forced to retreat.</i>

86
00:08:17.791 --> 00:08:18.917
<i>But Zeus knew</i>

87
00:08:19.084 --> 00:08:23.254
<i>that one day, Ares might return
to finish his mission.</i>

88
00:08:23.838 --> 00:08:26.299
<i>An endless war,</i>

89
00:08:26.466 --> 00:08:29.469
<i>where mankind would finally
destroy themselves,</i>

90
00:08:29.636 --> 00:08:32.430
<i>and us with them.</i>

91
00:08:32.597 --> 00:08:35.016
<i>So Zeus left us a weapon,</i>

92
00:08:35.183 --> 00:08:38.269
<i>one powerful enough to kill a God.</i>

93
00:08:39.437 --> 00:08:43.441
<i>With his dying breath,
Zeus created this island</i>

94
00:08:43.608 --> 00:08:45.860
<i>to hide us from the outside world,</i>

95
00:08:46.027 --> 00:08:48.363
<i>somewhere Ares could not find us.</i>

96
00:08:52.826 --> 00:08:55.120
<i>And all has been quiet ever since.</i>

97
00:09:02.836 --> 00:09:07.006
We give thanks to the Gods
for giving us this paradise.

98
00:09:08.967 --> 00:09:10.468
And the Godkiller?

99
00:09:15.181 --> 00:09:16.182
The Godkiller?

100
00:09:16.349 --> 00:09:18.977
The weapon that's strong enough
to kill a god.

101
00:09:19.978 --> 00:09:21.312
<i>Can I see it?</i>

102
00:09:31.364 --> 00:09:33.199
The Gods gave us many gifts.

103
00:09:33.867 --> 00:09:35.660
One day, you'll know them all.

104
00:09:36.161 --> 00:09:39.080
This great tower is where we keep them.

105
00:09:51.509 --> 00:09:52.677
The Godkiller.

106
00:09:56.514 --> 00:09:57.974
<i>It's beautiful.</i>

107
00:09:59.559 --> 00:10:00.935
Who would wield it?

108
00:10:03.438 --> 00:10:06.024
I pray it will never be called to arms.

109
00:10:06.733 --> 00:10:09.694
But only the fiercest among us even could.

110
00:10:10.278 --> 00:10:12.071
And that is not you, Diana.

111
00:10:12.864 --> 00:10:15.283
You see, you're safe,

112
00:10:15.784 --> 00:10:18.787
and there is nothing
you should concern yourself with.

113
00:10:32.342 --> 00:10:33.968
You keep doubting yourself, Diana.

114
00:10:34.135 --> 00:10:36.346
- No, I don't.
- Yes, you do.

115
00:10:37.055 --> 00:10:38.223
No, I don't.

116
00:10:43.061 --> 00:10:44.312
You are stronger than you believe.

117
00:10:44.479 --> 00:10:46.564
<i>You have greater powers than you know.</i>

118
00:10:46.731 --> 00:10:48.650
<i>- But if you don't try hard--
- Diana!</i>

119
00:11:00.411 --> 00:11:01.412
Are you hurt?

120
00:11:01.996 --> 00:11:03.164
No, Mother, I'm fine,

121
00:11:03.373 --> 00:11:05.041
- I was just--
- Training.

122
00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:09.045
It seems I'm not
the revered queen I should be.

123
00:11:09.212 --> 00:11:11.422
Disobeyed, betrayed by my own sister...

124
00:11:11.589 --> 00:11:13.800
No, Mother.
It was me, I asked her to--

125
00:11:13.967 --> 00:11:15.176
Take her to the palace.

126
00:11:17.011 --> 00:11:18.012
Off you go.

127
00:11:26.604 --> 00:11:28.731
You left me no choice, Hippolyta.

128
00:11:30.400 --> 00:11:33.152
You neglect your duty if she cannot fight.

129
00:11:33.319 --> 00:11:35.405
You speak of a time that may never come.

130
00:11:36.990 --> 00:11:38.491
He might never return.

131
00:11:39.576 --> 00:11:41.369
He could have died from his wounds.

132
00:11:41.536 --> 00:11:44.455
Ares is alive.

133
00:11:44.622 --> 00:11:47.959
You feel it, as I do, in your bones.

134
00:11:48.585 --> 00:11:51.254
It is only a matter of time
before he returns.

135
00:11:55.174 --> 00:11:59.012
The stronger she gets,
the sooner he'll find her.

136
00:11:59.178 --> 00:12:01.931
Hippolyta, I love her as you do.

137
00:12:03.474 --> 00:12:06.394
But this is the only way
to truly protect her.

138
00:12:17.447 --> 00:12:20.867
You will train her harder than
any Amazon before her.

139
00:12:21.618 --> 00:12:23.453
<i>Five times harder,</i>

140
00:12:23.620 --> 00:12:25.663
<i>ten times harder.</i>

141
00:12:25.830 --> 00:12:28.750
<i>Until she is better than even you.</i>

142
00:12:29.334 --> 00:12:31.294
<i>But she must never know the truth</i>

143
00:12:31.461 --> 00:12:33.212
<i>about what she is</i>

144
00:12:33.379 --> 00:12:35.214
<i>or how she came to be.</i>

145
00:13:29.852 --> 00:13:31.104
Harder.

146
00:13:31.270 --> 00:13:34.065
<i>You're stronger than this, Diana.</i>

147
00:13:34.273 --> 00:13:35.400
Again.

148
00:13:52.542 --> 00:13:54.002
Never let your guard down.

149
00:13:55.211 --> 00:13:56.963
You expect the battle to be fair.

150
00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:58.548
A battle will never be fair.

151
00:14:12.478 --> 00:14:13.479
Antiope!

152
00:14:15.398 --> 00:14:16.399
Lay still.

153
00:14:16.774 --> 00:14:17.775
You are bleeding.

154
00:14:19.527 --> 00:14:21.779
- I'm sorry...
- Wait, Diana, wait.

155
00:14:28.077 --> 00:14:29.245
What have I done?

156
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.165
I'm sorry.

157
00:17:03.774 --> 00:17:05.776
<i>Where did this fog come from?</i>

158
00:17:09.655 --> 00:17:12.200
There. Go forward!

159
00:17:29.342 --> 00:17:31.427
<i>There he is! The pilot! I can see him.</i>

160
00:17:31.594 --> 00:17:32.803
He's there!

161
00:18:03.668 --> 00:18:04.669
Wow.

162
00:18:07.755 --> 00:18:09.090
You're a man.

163
00:18:13.594 --> 00:18:16.347
Yeah. I mean...

164
00:18:18.516 --> 00:18:20.017
Do I not look like one?

165
00:18:24.605 --> 00:18:25.815
Where are we?

166
00:18:26.357 --> 00:18:27.858
Themyscira.

167
00:18:28.025 --> 00:18:29.277
Therma-what?

168
00:18:29.777 --> 00:18:30.778
Who are you?

169
00:18:39.161 --> 00:18:41.789
I'm one of the good guys,
and those are the bad guys.

170
00:18:41.956 --> 00:18:42.999
What?

171
00:18:43.165 --> 00:18:44.875
The Germans. Come on,
we need to get out of here.

172
00:18:45.042 --> 00:18:47.169
- The Germans?
<i>- Diana!</i>

173
00:18:47.336 --> 00:18:49.547
Step away from her, now!

174
00:18:51.799 --> 00:18:53.050
<i>Ready your bows!</i>

175
00:18:56.554 --> 00:18:57.888
They have guns, right?

176
00:18:58.055 --> 00:18:59.640
Fire!

177
00:19:00.850 --> 00:19:02.393
Fire!

178
00:19:03.519 --> 00:19:04.895
Come on!

179
00:20:42.076 --> 00:20:43.077
Stay there!

180
00:21:21.115 --> 00:21:22.199
Shield!

181
00:21:43.387 --> 00:21:45.139
No!

182
00:21:45.306 --> 00:21:46.307
No!

183
00:21:52.188 --> 00:21:53.564
No.

184
00:21:53.731 --> 00:21:57.693
No, no. Antiope. Antiope.

185
00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.529
Antiope, hey. Hey, hey.

186
00:22:02.323 --> 00:22:03.324
Hey.

187
00:22:03.908 --> 00:22:04.909
- Diana.
- Be still.

188
00:22:06.744 --> 00:22:08.204
The time has come.

189
00:22:09.413 --> 00:22:11.415
You... You must...

190
00:22:11.582 --> 00:22:14.752
What? What, Antiope?

191
00:22:18.881 --> 00:22:20.257
Godkiller.

192
00:22:20.841 --> 00:22:22.885
- Diana, go...
- Go where?

193
00:22:23.677 --> 00:22:25.012
- Go where?
- Go...

194
00:22:25.179 --> 00:22:28.057
No, please, no. No. No!

195
00:22:28.224 --> 00:22:30.184
No, no, no.

196
00:22:30.976 --> 00:22:32.811
- No!
- Antiope!

197
00:22:34.396 --> 00:22:35.564
No!

198
00:22:42.780 --> 00:22:44.114
- You.
- No.

199
00:22:45.533 --> 00:22:47.034
No, Mother, no.

200
00:22:47.201 --> 00:22:48.953
He fought at my side against the invaders.

201
00:22:49.119 --> 00:22:50.955
What man fights against his own people?

202
00:22:51.121 --> 00:22:53.958
- These aren't my people.
- Then why do you wear their colors?

203
00:22:56.085 --> 00:22:57.086
I can't tell you that.

204
00:22:57.253 --> 00:22:58.295
You need to tell us now!

205
00:22:58.462 --> 00:22:59.505
What is your name?

206
00:23:00.881 --> 00:23:02.258
I can't tell you that either.

207
00:23:03.092 --> 00:23:05.886
We should kill him now,
and be done with it.

208
00:23:06.053 --> 00:23:07.054
<i>If he dies,</i>

209
00:23:07.721 --> 00:23:12.393
we know nothing about who they are,
and why they came.

210
00:23:19.984 --> 00:23:21.735
My, uh,

211
00:23:23.153 --> 00:23:27.658
name is Captain Steve Trevor,
pilot, American Expeditionary Forces.

212
00:23:27.825 --> 00:23:30.953
Serial number 8141921.

213
00:23:31.161 --> 00:23:33.372
That's all I'm at liberty to...

214
00:23:37.668 --> 00:23:39.503
Assigned to British Intelligence.

215
00:23:41.297 --> 00:23:42.965
What the hell is this thing?

216
00:23:43.132 --> 00:23:46.176
The Lasso of Hestia compels you
to reveal the truth.

217
00:23:46.719 --> 00:23:48.178
But it's really hot.

218
00:23:48.345 --> 00:23:51.348
It is pointless, and painful, to resist.

219
00:23:52.099 --> 00:23:53.309
What is your mission?

220
00:23:53.475 --> 00:23:57.271
Whoever you are,
you are in more danger than you think.

221
00:23:57.438 --> 00:23:58.480
What is your mission?

222
00:24:01.859 --> 00:24:02.860
I am a...

223
00:24:07.531 --> 00:24:08.532
I am a...

224
00:24:11.869 --> 00:24:13.203
I am a spy.

225
00:24:16.540 --> 00:24:19.001
I'm a spy. I'm a spy.

226
00:24:21.754 --> 00:24:23.047
<i>British Intelligence got word</i>

227
00:24:23.213 --> 00:24:25.674
<i>that the leader of the German Army,
General Ludendorff,</i>

228
00:24:25.841 --> 00:24:29.720
<i>would be visiting a secret military
installation in the Ottoman Empire.</i>

229
00:24:29.887 --> 00:24:33.057
<i>I posed as one of their pilots,
and flew in with them.</i>

230
00:24:33.223 --> 00:24:36.727
<i>According to our intel,
the Germans had no troops left,</i>

231
00:24:36.894 --> 00:24:39.563
<i>no money, no munitions of any kind.</i>

232
00:24:39.730 --> 00:24:41.065
<i>But our intel was wrong.</i>

233
00:24:41.231 --> 00:24:43.942
<i>The Germans had the Turks
building bombs for them.</i>

234
00:24:44.109 --> 00:24:47.237
<i>And not just bombs, new weapons.</i>

235
00:24:47.404 --> 00:24:48.989
<i>Secret weapons.</i>

236
00:24:50.449 --> 00:24:55.204
<i>Invented by Ludendorff's
chief psychopath, Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

237
00:24:56.580 --> 00:24:59.083
<i>The boys in the trenches
called her "Dr. Poison."</i>

238
00:25:00.584 --> 00:25:01.710
<i>And for good reason.</i>

239
00:25:30.572 --> 00:25:34.076
<i>From what I could tell, if Dr. Maru
was able to complete her work,</i>

240
00:25:34.243 --> 00:25:37.287
<i>millions more would die.
The war would never end.</i>

241
00:25:37.955 --> 00:25:40.040
<i>I was there to observe and report,
nothing more,</i>

242
00:25:41.750 --> 00:25:43.585
<i>but I had to do something.</i>

243
00:25:48.674 --> 00:25:49.967
<i>I'm so close.</i>

244
00:25:50.134 --> 00:25:53.178
<i>I know I can make the gas
penetrate the mask.</i>

245
00:25:53.345 --> 00:25:55.556
I just... I need more time.

246
00:25:55.723 --> 00:25:57.474
Unfortunately, Doctor,
we do not have more time.

247
00:25:57.641 --> 00:25:59.560
This work, this...

248
00:26:04.898 --> 00:26:06.150
Get that man!

249
00:26:06.316 --> 00:26:07.526
<i>There!</i>

250
00:27:01.538 --> 00:27:04.958
But if I can get these notes back
to British Intelligence in time,

251
00:27:05.709 --> 00:27:08.295
it could stop millions more from dying.

252
00:27:09.296 --> 00:27:11.215
It could stop the war.

253
00:27:11.381 --> 00:27:13.509
War? What war?

254
00:27:15.719 --> 00:27:17.137
The war.

255
00:27:20.057 --> 00:27:22.559
The war to end all wars.

256
00:27:23.894 --> 00:27:25.604
<i>Four years,</i>

257
00:27:25.771 --> 00:27:28.023
<i>27 countries,</i>

258
00:27:28.190 --> 00:27:30.150
25 million dead,

259
00:27:30.734 --> 00:27:32.736
<i>soldiers and civilians.</i>

260
00:27:32.903 --> 00:27:34.822
Innocent people,

261
00:27:35.739 --> 00:27:37.991
women and children slaughtered.

262
00:27:39.326 --> 00:27:42.830
<i>Their homes and their villages
looted and burned.</i>

263
00:27:46.917 --> 00:27:49.169
Weapons far deadlier than you can

264
00:27:52.089 --> 00:27:53.590
ever imagine.

265
00:27:57.928 --> 00:27:59.680
It's like nothing I've ever seen.

266
00:28:01.098 --> 00:28:02.850
<i>It's like the world's going to end.</i>

267
00:28:05.102 --> 00:28:06.353
Should we let him go?

268
00:28:06.520 --> 00:28:09.106
And risk him bringing
more men to our shores?

269
00:28:09.273 --> 00:28:11.358
We cannot hold him forever, my queen.

270
00:28:11.525 --> 00:28:13.610
Mother. Excuse me,

271
00:28:13.777 --> 00:28:17.614
but after everything the man said,
this must be Ares.

272
00:28:17.781 --> 00:28:19.032
What are you talking about, child?

273
00:28:19.199 --> 00:28:22.202
Forgive me, Senator,
but the man called it "a war without end."

274
00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:25.289
Millions of people already dead.

275
00:28:25.789 --> 00:28:27.708
Like nothing he's ever seen.

276
00:28:28.292 --> 00:28:30.294
Only Ares could do such a thing.

277
00:28:32.296 --> 00:28:35.382
We cannot simply let him go.
We must go with him.

278
00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:38.218
I will not deploy our army
and leave Themyscira defenseless

279
00:28:38.385 --> 00:28:39.428
to go and fight their war.

280
00:28:39.595 --> 00:28:41.471
It is not their war.

281
00:28:41.638 --> 00:28:44.808
Zeus created man to be
just and wise, strong and passionate--

282
00:28:44.975 --> 00:28:47.394
That was a story, Diana!

283
00:28:47.561 --> 00:28:48.896
There is much you do not understand.

284
00:28:49.062 --> 00:28:50.105
Men are easily corrupted.

285
00:28:50.272 --> 00:28:53.066
Yes, but Ares is behind that corruption!

286
00:28:53.233 --> 00:28:56.111
It is Ares who has these Germans fighting.

287
00:28:56.278 --> 00:29:00.324
<i>And stopping the God of War
is our foreordinance.</i>

288
00:29:00.490 --> 00:29:02.910
As Amazons, this is our duty.

289
00:29:03.076 --> 00:29:05.913
But you are not an Amazon
like the rest of us.

290
00:29:06.955 --> 00:29:08.415
So you will do nothing.

291
00:29:09.082 --> 00:29:10.083
As your queen, I forbid it.

292
00:29:23.347 --> 00:29:24.514
Strange.

293
00:29:26.350 --> 00:29:28.310
Is it true you saved his life?

294
00:29:28.852 --> 00:29:29.853
Who told you that?

295
00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:31.021
He did.

296
00:29:54.378 --> 00:29:55.379
Whoa! I...

297
00:29:57.965 --> 00:29:59.549
I didn't see you come in.

298
00:30:04.888 --> 00:30:07.724
Would you say you're a

299
00:30:08.558 --> 00:30:11.144
typical example of your sex?

300
00:30:11.770 --> 00:30:13.438
I am

301
00:30:16.692 --> 00:30:18.402
above average.

302
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:23.156
What's that?

303
00:30:25.075 --> 00:30:26.493
It's a...

304
00:30:28.537 --> 00:30:29.538
Oh! Um...

305
00:30:31.748 --> 00:30:33.667
It's a watch.

306
00:30:34.084 --> 00:30:35.085
A watch?

307
00:30:35.252 --> 00:30:36.253
<i>Yeah, it's a watch.</i>

308
00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:37.838
It tells time.

309
00:30:38.839 --> 00:30:40.841
My father gave it to me.

310
00:30:42.551 --> 00:30:44.052
It's been through hell and back with him.

311
00:30:45.512 --> 00:30:48.473
Now it's with me,
and good thing it's still ticking.

312
00:30:49.516 --> 00:30:50.517
What for?

313
00:30:52.436 --> 00:30:54.021
Because it tells time.

314
00:30:55.439 --> 00:30:57.941
When to eat, sleep, wake up, work.

315
00:30:59.609 --> 00:31:02.487
You let this little thing
tell you what to do?

316
00:31:02.654 --> 00:31:04.114
Yeah.

317
00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:12.122
Can I ask you some questions?

318
00:31:13.582 --> 00:31:14.958
<i>- Where are we?</i>
- Themyscira.

319
00:31:15.125 --> 00:31:18.628
No, I got that before.
But I mean, where are we?

320
00:31:19.921 --> 00:31:21.214
What is this place?
Who are you people?

321
00:31:21.381 --> 00:31:23.467
Why does the water do that?

322
00:31:23.633 --> 00:31:26.136
<i>How come you don't know what a watch is?
How come you speak English so well?</i>

323
00:31:26.303 --> 00:31:28.430
We speak hundreds of languages.

324
00:31:29.306 --> 00:31:32.684
We are the bridge to
a greater understanding between all men.

325
00:31:34.895 --> 00:31:35.979
Right.

326
00:31:39.441 --> 00:31:42.652
You know, I didn't get a chance
to say this, uh, earlier,

327
00:31:44.071 --> 00:31:48.325
but thank you for dragging me
out of the water.

328
00:31:49.743 --> 00:31:51.161
Thank you

329
00:31:51.745 --> 00:31:53.830
for what you did on the beach.

330
00:32:01.963 --> 00:32:02.964
So,

331
00:32:04.341 --> 00:32:05.717
you're here to let me go?

332
00:32:07.135 --> 00:32:10.680
I tried, but it's not up to me.

333
00:32:11.223 --> 00:32:13.016
I even asked them to send me with you.

334
00:32:15.519 --> 00:32:16.937
Or anyone.

335
00:32:17.104 --> 00:32:18.146
An Amazon.

336
00:32:18.313 --> 00:32:19.981
The Amazons.

337
00:32:20.148 --> 00:32:21.608
The Amazons?

338
00:32:21.775 --> 00:32:24.528
<i>It is our sacred duty to defend the world.</i>

339
00:32:25.195 --> 00:32:27.030
And I wish to go.

340
00:32:29.699 --> 00:32:31.910
But my mother will not allow it.

341
00:32:34.329 --> 00:32:35.330
Well,

342
00:32:36.873 --> 00:32:38.875
I can't say I blame her.

343
00:32:39.042 --> 00:32:40.043
<i>The way this war is going,</i>

344
00:32:40.210 --> 00:32:43.130
I wouldn't want to
let anyone I care about near it.

345
00:32:43.296 --> 00:32:45.215
Then why do you want to go back?

346
00:32:45.757 --> 00:32:47.801
I don't think "want" is the word.

347
00:32:49.678 --> 00:32:52.180
I guess I gotta try.

348
00:32:54.057 --> 00:32:56.143
My father told me once,

349
00:32:56.309 --> 00:32:58.645
he said, "If you see something wrong
happening in the world,

350
00:32:58.812 --> 00:33:01.523
you can either do nothing,
or you can do something."

351
00:33:03.567 --> 00:33:05.402
And I already tried "nothing."

352
00:35:44.311 --> 00:35:45.353
Nice outfit.

353
00:35:46.646 --> 00:35:47.731
Oh, thank you.

354
00:35:48.481 --> 00:35:51.484
Now, I will show you the way off the island

355
00:35:52.068 --> 00:35:53.611
and you will take me to Ares.

356
00:35:54.446 --> 00:35:55.447
Deal.

357
00:36:04.622 --> 00:36:05.999
I'm leaving in that?

358
00:36:06.166 --> 00:36:07.417
We are.

359
00:36:08.835 --> 00:36:10.837
Yeah, we're leaving in that?

360
00:36:11.004 --> 00:36:12.464
Do you not know how to sail?

361
00:36:12.630 --> 00:36:13.757
Of course I know how to sail.

362
00:36:13.923 --> 00:36:15.592
Why wouldn't I know how to sail?
It's just...

363
00:36:16.634 --> 00:36:17.969
It's been a while.

364
00:36:47.457 --> 00:36:48.958
I'm going, Mother.

365
00:36:49.584 --> 00:36:52.754
I cannot stand by
while innocent lives are lost.

366
00:36:53.630 --> 00:36:58.051
If no one else will defend the world
from Ares, then I must.

367
00:36:59.844 --> 00:37:01.179
I have to go.

368
00:37:01.346 --> 00:37:02.722
I know.

369
00:37:03.890 --> 00:37:06.226
<i>Or at least I know I cannot stop you.</i>

370
00:37:11.940 --> 00:37:13.691
There is so much...

371
00:37:14.734 --> 00:37:15.944
So much you do not understand.

372
00:37:16.111 --> 00:37:17.570
<i>I understand enough.</i>

373
00:37:17.737 --> 00:37:21.282
That I'm willing to fight for those
who cannot fight for themselves.

374
00:37:23.993 --> 00:37:25.495
Like you once did.

375
00:37:26.162 --> 00:37:28.081
You know that if you choose to leave,

376
00:37:29.791 --> 00:37:31.167
you may never return.

377
00:37:33.086 --> 00:37:35.004
Who will I be if I stay?

378
00:37:43.888 --> 00:37:46.850
This belonged to
the greatest warrior in our history,

379
00:37:47.434 --> 00:37:50.019
our beloved Antiope.

380
00:37:50.186 --> 00:37:52.313
Make sure you are worthy of it.

381
00:37:53.898 --> 00:37:55.150
I will.

382
00:37:58.236 --> 00:38:00.738
Be careful in the world of men, Diana.

383
00:38:02.282 --> 00:38:04.659
They do not deserve you.

384
00:38:09.247 --> 00:38:12.208
You have been my greatest love.

385
00:38:16.296 --> 00:38:17.505
Today,

386
00:38:19.549 --> 00:38:21.551
you are my greatest sorrow.

387
00:39:00.423 --> 00:39:01.799
Should you have told her?

388
00:39:02.675 --> 00:39:07.138
The more she knows,
the sooner he'll find her.

389
00:39:18.775 --> 00:39:20.652
How long until we reach the war?

390
00:39:21.861 --> 00:39:23.988
The war? Which part?

391
00:39:24.155 --> 00:39:25.406
The Western Front in France

392
00:39:25.573 --> 00:39:27.951
is 400 miles long
from the Alps to the North Sea.

393
00:39:29.661 --> 00:39:31.538
Where the fighting
is the most intense, then.

394
00:39:31.704 --> 00:39:34.582
If you take me there,
I'm sure I'll find Ares.

395
00:39:38.503 --> 00:39:40.880
Ares? As in, the God of War?

396
00:39:41.047 --> 00:39:45.134
The God of War is our responsibility.
Only an Amazon can defeat him.

397
00:39:46.010 --> 00:39:47.637
With this.

398
00:39:49.097 --> 00:39:50.265
And once I do,

399
00:39:50.807 --> 00:39:52.433
the war will end.

400
00:39:59.566 --> 00:40:01.651
Look, I appreciate your spirit,

401
00:40:02.318 --> 00:40:04.362
<i>but this war is...</i>

402
00:40:04.529 --> 00:40:06.739
It's a great big mess.

403
00:40:07.615 --> 00:40:10.410
And there's not a whole lot
you and I can do about that.

404
00:40:10.577 --> 00:40:13.162
I mean, we can get back to London,
and try to get to the men who can.

405
00:40:13.329 --> 00:40:15.415
I'm the man who can!

406
00:40:15.582 --> 00:40:17.375
And once I find and destroy Ares,

407
00:40:17.542 --> 00:40:20.169
the German armies
will be freed from his influence

408
00:40:20.336 --> 00:40:23.339
and they will be good men again,
and the world will be better.

409
00:40:27.844 --> 00:40:28.845
Great.

410
00:40:29.762 --> 00:40:30.847
You'll see.

411
00:40:34.309 --> 00:40:35.351
What are you doing?

412
00:40:35.768 --> 00:40:37.854
Oh, I thought maybe you'd want to

413
00:40:39.272 --> 00:40:40.398
get some sleep.

414
00:40:43.359 --> 00:40:46.529
And what about you?
Are you not sleeping?

415
00:40:46.696 --> 00:40:48.364
Does the average man not sleep?

416
00:40:52.493 --> 00:40:55.622
Yes, we sleep.
We just don't sleep with, uh...

417
00:40:55.788 --> 00:40:56.789
You don't sleep with women?

418
00:40:56.956 --> 00:40:59.876
No. I mean, I do sleep with...
I sleep with...

419
00:41:01.210 --> 00:41:02.629
Yes, I do.

420
00:41:02.795 --> 00:41:05.256
But, out of the, uh,

421
00:41:05.465 --> 00:41:07.842
confines of marriage

422
00:41:08.009 --> 00:41:09.427
it's just...

423
00:41:11.888 --> 00:41:13.890
It's not polite to assume, you know?

424
00:41:17.644 --> 00:41:19.103
"Marriage"?

425
00:41:19.270 --> 00:41:21.189
Marriage. Do you not have that on...

426
00:41:22.440 --> 00:41:23.816
You go before a judge

427
00:41:23.983 --> 00:41:28.154
and you swear to love,
honor and cherish each other

428
00:41:28.321 --> 00:41:29.447
until death do you part.

429
00:41:30.323 --> 00:41:32.575
And do they?
Love each other till death?

430
00:41:32.742 --> 00:41:34.494
Not very often, no.

431
00:41:34.661 --> 00:41:36.079
Then why do they do it?

432
00:41:36.871 --> 00:41:39.332
I have no idea.

433
00:41:40.166 --> 00:41:41.834
So, you cannot sleep with me
unless I marry you.

434
00:41:42.001 --> 00:41:44.212
I will sleep with you, if you want.
I'll sleep right there.

435
00:41:44.379 --> 00:41:45.463
<i>There's plenty of room.</i>

436
00:41:45.630 --> 00:41:48.174
- Then, fine, if you don't mind...
- No, it's up to you.

437
00:41:48.341 --> 00:41:50.760
I know it's up to me, I'm making
the choice. I will come sleep with you.

438
00:41:50.927 --> 00:41:51.928
Okay.

439
00:41:54.806 --> 00:41:55.973
Yeah, just...

440
00:41:57.266 --> 00:41:58.476
Okay.

441
00:42:13.491 --> 00:42:18.121
You know, where I come from,
I'm not considered average.

442
00:42:18.871 --> 00:42:21.082
You know, being a spy,

443
00:42:21.249 --> 00:42:24.544
you have to show a certain amount of

444
00:42:26.587 --> 00:42:27.797
vigor.

445
00:42:31.050 --> 00:42:34.303
Have you never met a man before?
What about your father?

446
00:42:34.470 --> 00:42:36.222
I had no father.

447
00:42:36.889 --> 00:42:38.516
My mother sculpted me from clay

448
00:42:38.683 --> 00:42:40.810
and I was brought to life by Zeus.

449
00:42:44.188 --> 00:42:45.648
Well, that's neat.

450
00:42:49.235 --> 00:42:50.653
<i>Sorry.</i>

451
00:42:53.156 --> 00:42:54.657
Where I come from,

452
00:42:55.908 --> 00:42:58.202
babies are made differently.

453
00:42:59.203 --> 00:43:01.038
You refer to reproductive biology.

454
00:43:01.205 --> 00:43:02.790
- Yes, yes.
- Yeah, I know.

455
00:43:03.583 --> 00:43:05.126
I know all about that.

456
00:43:05.293 --> 00:43:08.129
I mean, I refer to that,
and other things.

457
00:43:09.046 --> 00:43:10.339
The pleasures of the flesh.

458
00:43:13.217 --> 00:43:15.136
Do you know about that?

459
00:43:16.304 --> 00:43:20.099
I've read all 12 volumes of Clio's
<i>Treatises on Bodily Pleasure.</i>

460
00:43:21.934 --> 00:43:23.978
- All 12, huh?
<i>- Mmm-hmm.</i>

461
00:43:28.608 --> 00:43:30.067
Did you bring any of those with you?

462
00:43:30.693 --> 00:43:31.861
You would not enjoy them.

463
00:43:32.028 --> 00:43:33.362
I don't know. Maybe.

464
00:43:33.529 --> 00:43:34.655
<i>No, you wouldn't.</i>

465
00:43:34.822 --> 00:43:36.199
Why not?

466
00:43:36.365 --> 00:43:39.494
They came to the conclusion that men
are essential for procreation,

467
00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:41.537
but when it comes to pleasure,

468
00:43:41.871 --> 00:43:43.790
unnecessary.

469
00:43:43.956 --> 00:43:45.458
No, no.

470
00:43:50.087 --> 00:43:51.088
Good night.

471
00:43:51.297 --> 00:43:52.548
Night.

472
00:44:05.061 --> 00:44:06.687
How long until we are operational?

473
00:44:06.854 --> 00:44:08.064
Two days, sir.

474
00:44:08.231 --> 00:44:09.899
You have until tonight, Captain.

475
00:44:10.066 --> 00:44:14.195
Sir, the men have had no food,
no sleep.

476
00:44:14.362 --> 00:44:16.531
Do you think I have had
any food or rest, Captain?

477
00:44:16.989 --> 00:44:18.616
Do you hear me making excuses?

478
00:44:18.783 --> 00:44:19.784
No.

479
00:44:19.951 --> 00:44:21.410
Your men are weak, complacent.

480
00:44:21.577 --> 00:44:24.539
You've let them forget that
an attack can happen at any time,

481
00:44:24.705 --> 00:44:26.123
from any quarter!

482
00:44:26.290 --> 00:44:27.458
So, let's you and I remind them,

483
00:44:27.625 --> 00:44:28.626
shall we?

484
00:44:43.432 --> 00:44:45.226
- Doctor.
- General.

485
00:44:45.393 --> 00:44:46.394
Progress?

486
00:44:46.561 --> 00:44:47.854
Not enough.

487
00:44:48.729 --> 00:44:50.690
It is over, General.

488
00:44:50.857 --> 00:44:52.733
Germany is giving up.

489
00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:56.821
Von Hindenburg has recommended
the <i>Kaiser</i> sign the armistice.

490
00:44:56.988 --> 00:44:59.031
We have run out of time.

491
00:45:00.658 --> 00:45:03.452
As soon as the <i>Kaiser</i>
sees the newest weapon,

492
00:45:03.619 --> 00:45:05.329
he will not sign the armistice.

493
00:45:05.496 --> 00:45:06.581
But, without my book--

494
00:45:06.747 --> 00:45:07.999
We will get your book!

495
00:45:08.165 --> 00:45:10.626
It is you that I believe in. Not it.

496
00:45:12.003 --> 00:45:15.047
I know that you can,
and will, succeed. Hmm.

497
00:45:16.883 --> 00:45:20.219
It is what you were put on this earth
to do.

498
00:45:23.848 --> 00:45:27.268
Something did come to me last night.

499
00:45:27.435 --> 00:45:29.437
A different type of gas.

500
00:45:30.354 --> 00:45:31.439
For you.

501
00:45:31.981 --> 00:45:33.983
<i>To restore your strength.</i>

502
00:46:04.096 --> 00:46:06.432
<i>I've got it. I've got it!</i>

503
00:46:07.016 --> 00:46:10.102
And if it's what I think,

504
00:46:11.270 --> 00:46:13.105
it's going to be

505
00:46:14.690 --> 00:46:16.192
terrible.

506
00:46:37.505 --> 00:46:38.673
<i>Morning!</i>

507
00:46:39.173 --> 00:46:41.717
We got lucky, we caught a ride.
We made some good time.

508
00:46:41.884 --> 00:46:44.220
<i>Welcome to jolly old London!</i>

509
00:46:44.595 --> 00:46:46.013
It's hideous.

510
00:46:46.555 --> 00:46:48.015
Yeah, it's not for everybody.

511
00:47:10.413 --> 00:47:11.872
- Morning, darling.
- What a beauty.

512
00:47:12.039 --> 00:47:13.040
Hello, beautiful!

513
00:47:13.207 --> 00:47:15.710
Gentlemen, eyes to yourself.
Thank you so much.

514
00:47:17.670 --> 00:47:19.630
Come on! Come on.

515
00:47:21.173 --> 00:47:22.758
Why are they holding hands?

516
00:47:23.050 --> 00:47:25.803
Uh, probably because they're together.

517
00:47:28.556 --> 00:47:31.100
No, no, no. We're not together.
I mean, in that way.

518
00:47:31.267 --> 00:47:32.268
This way.

519
00:47:32.435 --> 00:47:33.644
To the war!

520
00:47:33.811 --> 00:47:36.355
Well, technically, the war is that way.
But we gotta go this way first.

521
00:47:36.522 --> 00:47:38.024
And where are we going?

522
00:47:38.190 --> 00:47:39.942
We gotta get this notebook to my superiors.

523
00:47:40.109 --> 00:47:41.193
Hey, hey, hey!

524
00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:44.488
No, no, no.
I let you go, you take me to Ares.

525
00:47:44.655 --> 00:47:46.407
We made a deal, Steve Trevor.

526
00:47:46.574 --> 00:47:47.950
And a deal is a promise.

527
00:47:48.117 --> 00:47:49.952
And a promise is unbreakable.

528
00:47:50.703 --> 00:47:52.788
Oh, boy. Damn it. All right.

529
00:47:54.040 --> 00:47:55.875
You come with me first to deliver this,

530
00:47:56.042 --> 00:47:58.335
and then we'll get you a ticket,
uh...

531
00:47:58.586 --> 00:47:59.670
to the war.

532
00:47:59.962 --> 00:48:00.963
Deal?

533
00:48:02.465 --> 00:48:03.591
- Let's go.
- Diana...

534
00:48:03.758 --> 00:48:04.759
What are you doing?

535
00:48:04.925 --> 00:48:06.886
You can't do that because
you're not wearing any clothes.

536
00:48:07.053 --> 00:48:10.306
Let's go...
Let's go buy you some clothes.

537
00:48:10.473 --> 00:48:12.266
What do these women wear into battle?

538
00:48:12.433 --> 00:48:13.809
They don't, uh...

539
00:48:14.018 --> 00:48:15.603
A baby!

540
00:48:16.979 --> 00:48:18.230
- No, no, no. No babies.
- Oh... Oh...

541
00:48:18.397 --> 00:48:20.066
No, please. No babies.

542
00:48:20.232 --> 00:48:22.026
That one's not made out of clay.

543
00:48:22.359 --> 00:48:23.444
Come on.

544
00:48:23.611 --> 00:48:25.613
Diana! Please.

545
00:48:40.836 --> 00:48:43.339
Thank God! You're not dead!

546
00:48:44.840 --> 00:48:46.467
Hoorah and huzzah!

547
00:48:46.634 --> 00:48:48.928
I did think you were dead
until I got your call, you know?

548
00:48:49.512 --> 00:48:51.722
<i>He's been gone for weeks.
Not a single word.</i>

549
00:48:51.889 --> 00:48:52.890
<i>Very unlike him.</i>

550
00:48:53.057 --> 00:48:55.476
I'm introducing myself.
It's Etta Candy.

551
00:48:55.643 --> 00:48:57.645
I'm Steve Trevor's secretary.

552
00:48:57.812 --> 00:48:59.146
What is a secretary?

553
00:48:59.313 --> 00:49:00.689
Ooh! Well, I do everything.

554
00:49:00.856 --> 00:49:02.942
I go where he tells me to go,
and I do what he tells me to do.

555
00:49:03.567 --> 00:49:05.986
Well, where I'm from,
that's called slavery.

556
00:49:06.153 --> 00:49:07.279
I really like her.

557
00:49:07.446 --> 00:49:08.656
Fantastic. Ladies, after you.

558
00:49:08.823 --> 00:49:09.990
Oh, I do, I like her.

559
00:49:10.157 --> 00:49:12.076
And it does rather feel like that,

560
00:49:12.243 --> 00:49:13.786
except the pay is very good.

561
00:49:13.953 --> 00:49:16.288
We've got our work cut out for us,
haven't we?

562
00:49:18.457 --> 00:49:22.378
Is this what passes for armor
in your country?

563
00:49:24.046 --> 00:49:25.214
"Armor." It's fashion.

564
00:49:25.381 --> 00:49:26.841
Keeps our tummies in.

565
00:49:27.383 --> 00:49:28.634
Why must you keep them in?

566
00:49:28.801 --> 00:49:31.053
Only a woman with no tummy
would ask that question.

567
00:49:32.763 --> 00:49:36.308
Conservative,
but not entirely un-fun.

568
00:49:37.560 --> 00:49:38.936
Try it on, at least.

569
00:49:39.103 --> 00:49:40.146
Very well.

570
00:49:41.438 --> 00:49:43.023
- Ooh! Ah, ah, ah...
- No! No, no, no.

571
00:49:43.399 --> 00:49:44.525
Ooh!

572
00:49:49.864 --> 00:49:51.407
Come on! Oh!

573
00:50:00.124 --> 00:50:02.918
How can a woman possibly fight in this?

574
00:50:03.085 --> 00:50:04.170
Fight?

575
00:50:04.336 --> 00:50:05.921
We use our principles.

576
00:50:06.088 --> 00:50:07.798
I mean, that's how
we're going to get the vote.

577
00:50:07.965 --> 00:50:11.719
Although, I am not opposed to
engaging in a bit of fisticuffs,

578
00:50:11.886 --> 00:50:13.637
should the occasion arise.

579
00:50:14.972 --> 00:50:16.265
Lovely.

580
00:50:16.557 --> 00:50:17.558
Oop!

581
00:50:17.766 --> 00:50:20.186
It's itchy. It's choking me.

582
00:50:21.562 --> 00:50:23.647
Can't say I blame it.

583
00:50:23.814 --> 00:50:25.065
Etta.

584
00:50:25.232 --> 00:50:26.233
Where is she?

585
00:50:26.442 --> 00:50:28.777
Oh, she's trying on outfit number 226.

586
00:50:38.621 --> 00:50:41.749
Miss Candy, the whole point
was to make her look less

587
00:50:41.916 --> 00:50:43.083
<i>distracting.</i>

588
00:50:45.419 --> 00:50:46.420
May I?

589
00:50:51.133 --> 00:50:52.468
<i>Really? Specs?</i>

590
00:50:52.635 --> 00:50:54.762
And suddenly she's not the most
beautiful woman you've ever seen?

591
00:51:01.435 --> 00:51:02.645
Better.

592
00:51:13.781 --> 00:51:15.115
Yeah, that's not going to work.

593
00:51:15.282 --> 00:51:16.992
Please put the sword down, Diana.

594
00:51:17.159 --> 00:51:18.160
Diana!

595
00:51:19.411 --> 00:51:20.537
Let me try it by myself.

596
00:51:20.704 --> 00:51:21.789
After you, sir.

597
00:51:31.340 --> 00:51:32.341
Etta...

598
00:51:32.758 --> 00:51:35.094
Why don't I meet you back at the office

599
00:51:35.261 --> 00:51:37.346
and, meanwhile,
I'll take this for safekeeping.

600
00:51:37.513 --> 00:51:38.514
Oh, no, I don't think so.

601
00:51:38.681 --> 00:51:40.432
You gotta put the sword down, Diana.
Please.

602
00:51:40.599 --> 00:51:41.850
- It doesn't go with the outfit.
- At all.

603
00:51:42.017 --> 00:51:44.645
Put the sword down, first of all.

604
00:51:47.064 --> 00:51:50.651
Promise me you will protect it
with your life.

605
00:51:51.193 --> 00:51:52.945
Yes... No.

606
00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:55.239
You can trust her. Just hand that over.

607
00:51:55.406 --> 00:51:57.241
- Shield.
- And the shield to her.

608
00:51:57.408 --> 00:51:58.409
There we go. Whoa!

609
00:51:58.575 --> 00:51:59.576
You got it? Thanks, Etta.

610
00:51:59.743 --> 00:52:01.662
This is easy.

611
00:52:03.038 --> 00:52:04.415
Oh. There we go.

612
00:52:32.276 --> 00:52:33.277
What is it?

613
00:52:35.112 --> 00:52:37.531
Hopefully nothing. Come on.

614
00:52:47.207 --> 00:52:49.251
- Steve, why are we hiding?
- Shh! Come on, come on.

615
00:52:58.802 --> 00:53:00.471
Captain Trevor.

616
00:53:01.305 --> 00:53:04.433
I believe you have something that is
the property of General Ludendorff.

617
00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.729
Ah, it's the, uh, bad-guy convention.

618
00:53:08.937 --> 00:53:11.440
Give us Dr. Maru's notebook.

619
00:53:12.066 --> 00:53:13.567
Where did I put that thing?

620
00:53:14.610 --> 00:53:17.029
Stand back!

621
00:53:27.664 --> 00:53:28.749
Or maybe not.

622
00:53:44.807 --> 00:53:45.974
Tough luck.

623
00:53:52.147 --> 00:53:54.316
Is there anything else you want to show me?

624
00:53:55.651 --> 00:53:56.819
Where do you think you're going?

625
00:53:59.405 --> 00:54:00.823
Oh!

626
00:54:03.575 --> 00:54:06.286
I'm sorry. But you are
clearly under his control.

627
00:54:06.453 --> 00:54:09.164
- Diana...
- Let me help you get free.

628
00:54:09.331 --> 00:54:10.874
Where will I find Ares?

629
00:54:18.215 --> 00:54:20.509
- He's... He's dead.
- Hmm.

630
00:54:21.218 --> 00:54:22.511
Cyanide.

631
00:54:31.353 --> 00:54:33.063
Stay here. I'll be right back.

632
00:54:33.230 --> 00:54:36.024
<i>Gentlemen! Gentlemen, please!</i>

633
00:54:36.859 --> 00:54:40.654
The sad truth is, the majority of them
don't even know what they're fighting for!

634
00:54:40.821 --> 00:54:41.822
Let him speak!

635
00:54:41.989 --> 00:54:44.158
Yes, thank you. Gentlemen...

636
00:54:44.700 --> 00:54:48.745
Germany is an immensely proud nation.

637
00:54:50.038 --> 00:54:51.874
They will never surrender.

638
00:54:52.291 --> 00:54:54.918
Now, look.
The only way to end this war...

639
00:54:55.085 --> 00:54:58.422
Colonel,
I have to talk to you outside.

640
00:54:58.589 --> 00:55:00.841
<i>...and restore world peace</i>

641
00:55:01.008 --> 00:55:02.551
is to negotiate

642
00:55:04.261 --> 00:55:05.971
an armistice.

643
00:55:06.555 --> 00:55:08.974
<i>- There's a woman in here.
- Um...</i>

644
00:55:09.141 --> 00:55:10.601
What's she doing in here?
Get her out.

645
00:55:12.478 --> 00:55:13.729
Get her out.

646
00:55:14.396 --> 00:55:15.439
Sorry.

647
00:55:15.606 --> 00:55:17.900
Blind sister.
She got lost on the way to the bathroom.

648
00:55:18.066 --> 00:55:20.068
I think it's this way.
Sorry, guys.

649
00:55:20.777 --> 00:55:22.946
Um...
Our only aim at this time

650
00:55:23.113 --> 00:55:25.741
must be to achieve peace,

651
00:55:25.908 --> 00:55:27.784
at any cost!

652
00:55:31.288 --> 00:55:33.582
Why do they not let him speak?
He's talking peace.

653
00:55:33.749 --> 00:55:35.250
Not right now. Sorry.

654
00:55:40.088 --> 00:55:42.799
Trevor, what the hell were you thinking,
bringing a woman into the Council Chamber?

655
00:55:42.966 --> 00:55:44.927
The intel that I brought back
is time-sensitive.

656
00:55:45.093 --> 00:55:46.512
This is one of Dr. Maru's notebooks.

657
00:55:46.678 --> 00:55:47.679
Notebook or not--

658
00:55:47.846 --> 00:55:48.847
We need to get it to cryptography

659
00:55:49.014 --> 00:55:50.599
and I need an immediate audience
with the generals.

660
00:55:50.766 --> 00:55:52.935
You do not just barge in here
and demand an audience with the Cabinet.

661
00:55:53.101 --> 00:55:54.645
Sir, with all due respect,
what I saw in my last mission

662
00:55:54.811 --> 00:55:55.854
could change the course of the war.

663
00:55:56.021 --> 00:55:57.439
<i>Captain Trevor!</i>

664
00:55:59.024 --> 00:56:00.651
I heard we'd lost you
on one of your missions,

665
00:56:00.817 --> 00:56:02.319
yet here you are,
back from the dead,

666
00:56:02.486 --> 00:56:04.404
and I see you've brought a friend with you.

667
00:56:04.571 --> 00:56:05.948
Our deepest apologies
for the interruption, sir.

668
00:56:06.114 --> 00:56:07.741
No, no, no. Nonsense.

669
00:56:07.908 --> 00:56:09.618
Thanks to this young woman,

670
00:56:09.785 --> 00:56:13.288
the room was finally quiet enough for me
to get at least a few words in.

671
00:56:13.455 --> 00:56:15.332
Sir Patrick Morgan, at your service.

672
00:56:15.999 --> 00:56:17.960
Diana, Princess of Themys--

673
00:56:18.126 --> 00:56:19.962
"Prince." Diana Prince.

674
00:56:20.796 --> 00:56:21.838
She is, uh...

675
00:56:22.005 --> 00:56:23.006
And I...

676
00:56:23.173 --> 00:56:24.216
Are...

677
00:56:24.383 --> 00:56:25.384
Working together.

678
00:56:25.551 --> 00:56:27.511
<i>She actually helped me
bring this, uh, notebook back here.</i>

679
00:56:27.678 --> 00:56:29.972
<i>That's from Dr. Maru's lab.</i>

680
00:56:30.138 --> 00:56:32.808
I think the information contained inside
will change the course of the war, sir.

681
00:56:32.975 --> 00:56:34.810
My God.

682
00:56:35.769 --> 00:56:37.813
- Dr. Poison, herself.
- Yes.

683
00:57:07.968 --> 00:57:09.011
<i>Yes.</i>

684
00:57:09.678 --> 00:57:11.096
<i>Intriguing.</i>

685
00:57:11.263 --> 00:57:12.556
Any further intelligence?

686
00:57:12.723 --> 00:57:15.767
Sadly not, sir.
Cryptography have had no luck.

687
00:57:15.934 --> 00:57:17.853
It seems like it's a mixture
of two languages,

688
00:57:18.061 --> 00:57:21.565
but, as yet, they've failed
to determine which two languages.

689
00:57:21.732 --> 00:57:23.358
Ottoman and Sumerian.

690
00:57:25.861 --> 00:57:28.238
Surely, someone else in this room
knew that.

691
00:57:28.405 --> 00:57:29.489
Who is this woman?

692
00:57:29.656 --> 00:57:31.366
<i>She's my, um,</i>

693
00:57:32.034 --> 00:57:33.076
secretary, sir.

694
00:57:33.660 --> 00:57:35.912
And she can understand
Ottoman and Sumerian?

695
00:57:36.496 --> 00:57:37.956
She's a very good secretary.

696
00:57:38.123 --> 00:57:39.541
See her out.

697
00:57:40.167 --> 00:57:42.836
Sir, if this woman can read it,

698
00:57:43.003 --> 00:57:44.838
<i>we should hear what she has to say.</i>

699
00:57:45.005 --> 00:57:46.715
Yes, very well.

700
00:57:52.596 --> 00:57:54.389
It's a formula

701
00:57:54.973 --> 00:57:56.433
for a new kind of gas.

702
00:57:57.017 --> 00:58:00.520
Mustard gas.
Hydrogen-based, instead of sulfur.

703
00:58:00.687 --> 00:58:01.772
Hydrogen-based...

704
00:58:01.938 --> 00:58:04.566
Gas masks would be useless
against hydrogen.

705
00:58:04.733 --> 00:58:07.569
The book says they plan to release the gas

706
00:58:07.736 --> 00:58:09.071
at "the front"?

707
00:58:09.237 --> 00:58:10.238
When?

708
00:58:10.405 --> 00:58:11.573
It doesn't say.

709
00:58:12.032 --> 00:58:13.325
Wait. "Front" of what?

710
00:58:13.492 --> 00:58:14.493
Sir,

711
00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:16.453
that is the evidence we need.

712
00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:18.080
You have to find out
where they're making that gas.

713
00:58:18.246 --> 00:58:19.414
You have to burn it to the ground.

714
00:58:19.581 --> 00:58:20.582
Destroy it.

715
00:58:20.749 --> 00:58:23.293
Ludendorff was last seen in Belgium.

716
00:58:23.460 --> 00:58:27.589
We can't be seen sending troops
into German-occupied Belgium

717
00:58:27.756 --> 00:58:30.467
as we are negotiating their surrender.

718
00:58:30.634 --> 00:58:32.386
Sir, I've seen that gas with my own eyes.

719
00:58:32.552 --> 00:58:35.305
If it is used,
it will kill everyone on both sides.

720
00:58:35.472 --> 00:58:36.515
They will all die.

721
00:58:36.682 --> 00:58:39.601
That is what soldiers do, Captain.

722
00:58:40.435 --> 00:58:42.187
<i>Send me in
with some logistical support.</i>

723
00:58:42.354 --> 00:58:45.482
At least give me the chance
to take out Ludendorff's operation myself.

724
00:58:45.649 --> 00:58:46.775
Are you insane?

725
00:58:46.942 --> 00:58:49.236
I can't introduce rogue elements
this late in the game.

726
00:58:49.403 --> 00:58:50.404
Sir, I can--

727
00:58:50.570 --> 00:58:51.780
<i>Now, more than ever,</i>

728
00:58:51.947 --> 00:58:55.617
the armistice is of paramount importance.

729
00:58:55.784 --> 00:58:59.413
It must be negotiated, it must be signed,
and this is...

730
00:59:00.288 --> 00:59:02.958
Well, it's the best way
of stopping the war.

731
00:59:03.125 --> 00:59:05.127
Captain, you will do nothing.

732
00:59:05.293 --> 00:59:07.295
And that is an order.

733
00:59:08.255 --> 00:59:09.256
Yes, sir.

734
00:59:10.465 --> 00:59:11.466
I understand, sir.

735
00:59:12.426 --> 00:59:13.468
I don't!

736
00:59:13.927 --> 00:59:15.262
Diana, I know this is confusing...

737
00:59:15.429 --> 00:59:17.472
<i>- It is not confusing! It's unthinkable!</i>
- Who is this woman?

738
00:59:17.639 --> 00:59:18.640
She's with me. She's with us, sir.

739
00:59:18.807 --> 00:59:19.891
I am not with you!

740
00:59:20.058 --> 00:59:23.145
You would knowingly sacrifice
all those lives,

741
00:59:23.311 --> 00:59:24.312
as if they mean less than yours!

742
00:59:24.479 --> 00:59:26.148
- Diana, let's talk about this outside.
- As if they mean nothing?

743
00:59:26.314 --> 00:59:29.651
Where I come from, generals don't
hide in their offices like cowards.

744
00:59:29.818 --> 00:59:31.945
- That's enough!
- They fight alongside their soldiers.

745
00:59:32.112 --> 00:59:33.655
They die with them on the battlefield!

746
00:59:33.822 --> 00:59:35.198
- That's enough!
- You should be ashamed.

747
00:59:35.365 --> 00:59:37.200
- My apologies. Diana...
- You should be ashamed.

748
00:59:37.367 --> 00:59:38.744
<i>- Diana...
- All of you should be ashamed!</i>

749
00:59:40.162 --> 00:59:41.788
Please slow down!

750
00:59:41.955 --> 00:59:43.290
That's your leader?

751
00:59:43.457 --> 00:59:45.625
How could he say that?
Believe that?

752
00:59:45.792 --> 00:59:47.210
And you!

753
00:59:47.377 --> 00:59:49.171
Was your duty to simply give them a book?

754
00:59:49.337 --> 00:59:50.338
No!

755
00:59:50.505 --> 00:59:51.673
You didn't stand your ground!
You didn't fight!

756
00:59:51.840 --> 00:59:53.300
Because there was no chance
of changing his mind!

757
00:59:53.467 --> 00:59:56.136
This is Ares, and he's not going to
allow a negotiation

758
00:59:56.303 --> 00:59:57.721
or a surrender!

759
00:59:57.888 --> 01:00:00.515
The millions of people you talked about,
they will die!

760
01:00:00.682 --> 01:00:02.142
We are going anyway!

761
01:00:04.686 --> 01:00:06.271
You mean, you were lying?

762
01:00:06.855 --> 01:00:08.648
I'm a spy! That's what I do!

763
01:00:08.815 --> 01:00:09.858
How do I know
you're not lying to me right now?

764
01:00:15.530 --> 01:00:17.032
I am taking you to the front.

765
01:00:17.699 --> 01:00:19.743
We are probably going to die.

766
01:00:20.660 --> 01:00:22.704
This is a terrible idea.

767
01:00:27.375 --> 01:00:29.336
We're going to need reinforcements.

768
01:00:39.721 --> 01:00:41.181
These are the reinforcements?

769
01:00:41.348 --> 01:00:42.766
Yup.

770
01:00:43.183 --> 01:00:44.935
Are these even good men?

771
01:00:45.852 --> 01:00:47.062
Hmm. Relatively.

772
01:00:48.355 --> 01:00:52.067
Even in Africa, gentlemen,
we haven't seen such luxuries.

773
01:00:52.234 --> 01:00:56.530
But the luxury that we have now...
It's like we can't stop making money!

774
01:00:56.696 --> 01:00:58.949
So, my uncle, the prince, and I--

775
01:00:59.115 --> 01:01:01.326
Boy! Which prince is that?

776
01:01:01.868 --> 01:01:03.954
I decide to extend the opportunity
for a few good soldiers--

777
01:01:04.120 --> 01:01:05.580
But, seriously, which prince?

778
01:01:06.414 --> 01:01:09.417
Hey, Sultan Angora Mynx Cashmere,

779
01:01:09.584 --> 01:01:11.253
<i>could I talk to you for a minute?</i>

780
01:01:11.586 --> 01:01:13.755
Gentlemen,
excuse me one second.

781
01:01:14.506 --> 01:01:15.507
"Bar." Well, a "pub."

782
01:01:15.674 --> 01:01:18.927
You bugger. I have been greasing
those peacocks all night, and you...

783
01:01:19.970 --> 01:01:21.763
Oh, my goodness gracious.

784
01:01:22.639 --> 01:01:23.765
That's a work of art.

785
01:01:23.932 --> 01:01:25.559
Sameer, Diana. Diana, Sameer.

786
01:01:25.725 --> 01:01:27.894
Hi, Diana.
You can call me Sammy, please.

787
01:01:28.061 --> 01:01:29.062
"Sammy."

788
01:01:29.229 --> 01:01:31.439
Sameer, I wouldn't do that,
if I were you.

789
01:01:31.606 --> 01:01:32.941
Sameer's a top undercover man.

790
01:01:33.108 --> 01:01:35.443
<i>He can talk the skin off a cat
in as many languages as you can.</i>

791
01:01:54.296 --> 01:01:55.380
Oh, you're done.

792
01:01:55.547 --> 01:01:56.548
Where's Charlie?

793
01:02:00.468 --> 01:02:01.553
<i>Le voilà.</i>

794
01:02:04.723 --> 01:02:07.017
At least this "Charlie"
is good with his fists.

795
01:02:07.976 --> 01:02:09.185
That's not Charlie.

796
01:02:17.110 --> 01:02:18.153
That's Charlie.

797
01:02:22.490 --> 01:02:23.491
Steven!

798
01:02:23.950 --> 01:02:26.494
May God put a flower upon your head, son.

799
01:02:26.661 --> 01:02:27.954
Good to see you.

800
01:02:29.456 --> 01:02:31.499
<i>So, what were you fighting about?</i>

801
01:02:32.459 --> 01:02:35.378
I mistook his glass for mine.
It happens.

802
01:02:35.545 --> 01:02:37.130
This man is no fighter.

803
01:02:37.297 --> 01:02:39.174
Charlie is an expert marksman.

804
01:02:39.674 --> 01:02:40.675
It means he shoots people.

805
01:02:40.842 --> 01:02:42.510
From very far away.

806
01:02:42.844 --> 01:02:44.304
They never know what hit them.

807
01:02:45.972 --> 01:02:48.558
So, how do you know who you kill
if you can't see their face?

808
01:02:48.725 --> 01:02:50.894
I don't. Trust me, it's better that way.

809
01:02:51.061 --> 01:02:52.437
You fight without honor.

810
01:02:53.021 --> 01:02:54.648
Who gets paid for honor? Eh?

811
01:02:55.982 --> 01:02:57.359
So, what's the job, boss?

812
01:02:58.860 --> 01:02:59.986
Uh, two days, tops.

813
01:03:00.153 --> 01:03:02.572
We need, uh, supplies
and passage to Belgium.

814
01:03:02.739 --> 01:03:03.823
And what's the going rate?

815
01:03:03.990 --> 01:03:05.033
Better be a good pay.

816
01:03:05.200 --> 01:03:07.327
Yeah, well, here's the thing.

817
01:03:08.161 --> 01:03:10.330
Um, I told you it was going to be quick.

818
01:03:11.790 --> 01:03:14.334
And there's a lot to be gained by this.

819
01:03:14.501 --> 01:03:16.378
So, it's for a great cause...

820
01:03:16.795 --> 01:03:17.796
Uh, freedom...

821
01:03:18.004 --> 01:03:19.005
Hmm.

822
01:03:19.214 --> 01:03:20.590
Friendship,

823
01:03:23.176 --> 01:03:24.177
uh, ending the war, friendship--

824
01:03:24.344 --> 01:03:25.679
- Okay, you have no money.
- No.

825
01:03:33.353 --> 01:03:34.604
What?

826
01:03:34.771 --> 01:03:35.897
What is this?

827
01:03:36.064 --> 01:03:37.524
We're going to drop her off at the front.

828
01:03:37.691 --> 01:03:39.317
- "Dropping her off"?
- Yeah.

829
01:03:39.943 --> 01:03:42.195
Listen, sweetheart,
I'm not going to get myself killed

830
01:03:42.362 --> 01:03:43.530
helping a wee lassie out of a ditch.

831
01:03:43.697 --> 01:03:45.740
- Know what I mean?
- Here's the little thief now!

832
01:03:45.907 --> 01:03:47.909
We don't need your kind around here.

833
01:03:58.086 --> 01:03:59.337
She did it!

834
01:03:59.921 --> 01:04:02.799
I'm both frightened and aroused.

835
01:04:09.097 --> 01:04:10.724
- Oh, here they are! Sorry I'm late.
- Sir Patrick!

836
01:04:10.890 --> 01:04:12.392
Yes, that's what I was going to mention.

837
01:04:14.269 --> 01:04:16.062
- Sir Patrick.
<i>- Oh, no, no, no.</i>

838
01:04:16.229 --> 01:04:18.398
Please, gentlemen, sit.
Miss Prince, sit.

839
01:04:22.610 --> 01:04:24.821
I assume you're here planning something

840
01:04:24.988 --> 01:04:28.158
that's going to get you either
court-martialed or killed.

841
01:04:28.324 --> 01:04:30.201
And I assume you're here to stop us.

842
01:04:30.827 --> 01:04:31.953
No.

843
01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:33.788
Not at all, in fact.

844
01:04:34.789 --> 01:04:35.790
Well, look.

845
01:04:35.957 --> 01:04:37.250
I was a younger man, once.

846
01:04:37.417 --> 01:04:40.420
And, had I been in better health, I'd like
to think that I might do the same.

847
01:04:40.628 --> 01:04:41.629
Hmm.

848
01:04:41.838 --> 01:04:44.090
<i>It's a very,
very honorable thing you're doing.</i>

849
01:04:44.257 --> 01:04:45.258
Therefore,

850
01:04:46.468 --> 01:04:47.802
I'm here to help.

851
01:04:48.470 --> 01:04:49.846
Unofficially, of course.

852
01:04:50.972 --> 01:04:52.182
What's your plan?

853
01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:56.644
If there's another weapons facility,
find it and destroy it.

854
01:04:57.145 --> 01:04:59.105
Along with Ludendorff and Maru.

855
01:05:00.356 --> 01:05:03.109
In that case, to allay suspicion,

856
01:05:03.777 --> 01:05:07.906
the charming Etta, here,
could, uh, run the mission from my office.

857
01:05:08.490 --> 01:05:09.491
"Run"...

858
01:05:11.701 --> 01:05:12.702
Also,

859
01:05:13.661 --> 01:05:16.164
there's enough here for a few days.

860
01:05:21.669 --> 01:05:22.712
Thank you, sir.

861
01:05:22.879 --> 01:05:24.464
You're very welcome.

862
01:05:25.006 --> 01:05:27.050
Take great care, all of you,

863
01:05:27.217 --> 01:05:28.218
<i>and good luck.</i>

864
01:05:39.562 --> 01:05:40.563
Cheers!

865
01:05:49.614 --> 01:05:51.533
Fresh ice cream, made today. Hello, miss.

866
01:05:51.699 --> 01:05:53.034
Would you like to buy an ice cream?

867
01:05:53.201 --> 01:05:54.786
- Me?
- Are you hungry?

868
01:05:54.953 --> 01:05:55.954
Yes.

869
01:05:56.162 --> 01:05:57.372
Thank you.

870
01:05:57.539 --> 01:05:58.581
Eight pence, please, sir.

871
01:05:58.748 --> 01:06:00.041
Here you go, pal. Keep the change.

872
01:06:00.208 --> 01:06:02.377
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Mmm.

873
01:06:02.585 --> 01:06:04.045
- What do you think?
- It's wonderful!

874
01:06:04.212 --> 01:06:05.213
Yeah.

875
01:06:06.381 --> 01:06:08.842
- You should be very proud.
<i>- Thank you very much!</i>

876
01:06:09.008 --> 01:06:10.385
You should be very proud.

877
01:06:13.721 --> 01:06:17.058
<i>It's a long way to Tipperary</i>

878
01:06:17.225 --> 01:06:20.603
<i>It's a long way to go</i>

879
01:06:20.770 --> 01:06:24.023
I hope our guy meets us here.
Chief's expecting us before dark.

880
01:06:24.732 --> 01:06:25.775
"Chief"?

881
01:06:26.776 --> 01:06:28.403
Uh, yeah. A smuggler.

882
01:06:29.237 --> 01:06:30.697
Very reputable.

883
01:06:31.072 --> 01:06:34.200
A liar, a murderer, and now a smuggler.

884
01:06:34.742 --> 01:06:35.743
Lovely.

885
01:06:36.244 --> 01:06:37.537
Careful, I might get offended.

886
01:06:37.704 --> 01:06:39.247
I wasn't referring to you.

887
01:06:39.706 --> 01:06:40.707
Really?

888
01:06:40.957 --> 01:06:42.917
I went undercover
and pretended to be somebody else,

889
01:06:43.084 --> 01:06:44.752
shot people on your beach,
and smuggled a notebook.

890
01:06:44.919 --> 01:06:47.422
Liar, murderer, smuggler.
Are you still coming?

891
01:07:07.066 --> 01:07:08.067
It's awful.

892
01:07:09.444 --> 01:07:10.945
That's why we're here.

893
01:07:29.005 --> 01:07:30.798
The gas will kill everything.

894
01:07:30.965 --> 01:07:33.676
What kind of weapon kills innocents?

895
01:07:34.135 --> 01:07:35.678
In this war,

896
01:07:35.845 --> 01:07:37.180
every kind.

897
01:07:42.685 --> 01:07:45.188
You were absent
at the council meeting, General.

898
01:07:45.355 --> 01:07:48.066
I see you are negotiating the terms
of the armistice without me.

899
01:07:48.233 --> 01:07:50.985
- On the <i>Kaiser's</i> behalf.
- And on your insistence!

900
01:07:51.527 --> 01:07:54.614
We could easily win this war,
if only you had a little faith.

901
01:07:54.781 --> 01:07:56.074
<i>We don't.</i>

902
01:07:56.241 --> 01:07:57.909
<i>There are shortages of food,</i>

903
01:07:58.076 --> 01:07:59.869
medicine, ammunition.

904
01:08:00.995 --> 01:08:04.749
Every hour we delay
costs thousands of German lives.

905
01:08:04.916 --> 01:08:07.585
One attack and the war can be ours!

906
01:08:10.255 --> 01:08:12.090
As we speak, my chemist--

907
01:08:12.257 --> 01:08:14.467
We stand against you and your

908
01:08:14.759 --> 01:08:15.760
witch.

909
01:08:16.219 --> 01:08:18.096
Ludendorff, enough!

910
01:08:19.472 --> 01:08:21.432
Twenty-four hours from now,

911
01:08:21.599 --> 01:08:23.685
this war will end.

912
01:08:24.269 --> 01:08:25.770
It is over.

913
01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:28.564
It is over for you.

914
01:08:32.193 --> 01:08:33.736
It is over for all of you.

915
01:08:50.628 --> 01:08:51.963
But the mask won't help.

916
01:08:52.130 --> 01:08:54.007
They don't know that.

917
01:09:08.980 --> 01:09:09.981
Let's go!

918
01:09:10.148 --> 01:09:12.442
Time to stage a demonstration
for the <i>Kaiser!</i>

919
01:09:14.902 --> 01:09:15.945
You're late.

920
01:09:16.112 --> 01:09:17.488
<i>Cowboy sneak-attack, Chief!</i>

921
01:09:18.489 --> 01:09:19.490
How are you?

922
01:09:20.325 --> 01:09:21.826
- Good to see you, pal.
<i>- Okay, big man!</i>

923
01:09:24.662 --> 01:09:26.497
- Good to see you.
- Ah, yes!

924
01:09:27.248 --> 01:09:28.750
Good to see you, my friend.

925
01:09:29.667 --> 01:09:30.918
You beauty!

926
01:09:31.669 --> 01:09:33.046
Who is this?

927
01:09:39.844 --> 01:09:41.471
And I am Diana.

928
01:09:42.347 --> 01:09:43.389
Where did you find her?

929
01:09:43.931 --> 01:09:45.099
She found me.

930
01:09:45.683 --> 01:09:47.977
- I plucked him from the sea.
<i>- It's a long story.</i>

931
01:09:48.144 --> 01:09:49.228
We don't have to talk about that right now.

932
01:09:49.395 --> 01:09:50.813
What's there?

933
01:09:51.981 --> 01:09:53.983
British tea for the Germans,

934
01:09:54.150 --> 01:09:56.110
German beer for the British.

935
01:09:57.820 --> 01:10:00.198
And Edgar Rice Burroughs novels for both.

936
01:10:00.365 --> 01:10:01.407
And guns!

937
01:10:03.368 --> 01:10:06.287
Well, may we get what we want!

938
01:10:06.454 --> 01:10:07.789
May we get what we need.

939
01:10:07.955 --> 01:10:10.208
But may we never get what we deserve.

940
01:10:10.375 --> 01:10:11.751
Bang!

941
01:10:18.674 --> 01:10:20.009
Strange thunder.

942
01:10:21.552 --> 01:10:23.054
German 77s.

943
01:10:23.388 --> 01:10:24.722
Guns. Big ones.

944
01:10:25.973 --> 01:10:27.308
It's the front, out there.

945
01:10:28.643 --> 01:10:30.019
The evening hate.

946
01:10:30.728 --> 01:10:32.647
So, who do you fight for in this war?

947
01:10:32.814 --> 01:10:33.981
I don't fight.

948
01:10:34.148 --> 01:10:36.150
<i>You're here for profit, then?</i>

949
01:10:36.526 --> 01:10:38.528
No better place to be.

950
01:10:39.862 --> 01:10:41.989
Nowhere better to be than in a war
where you don't take a side?

951
01:10:42.156 --> 01:10:43.324
<i>I have nowhere else.</i>

952
01:10:43.866 --> 01:10:45.326
The last war
took everything from my people.

953
01:10:45.493 --> 01:10:46.786
We have nothing left.

954
01:10:47.662 --> 01:10:48.871
At least here,

955
01:10:49.664 --> 01:10:51.082
I'm free.

956
01:10:51.666 --> 01:10:53.543
Who took that from your people?

957
01:10:54.168 --> 01:10:55.503
His people.

958
01:11:00.550 --> 01:11:01.551
<i>Don't go...</i>

959
01:11:02.260 --> 01:11:04.887
Don't go in. Don't go!

960
01:11:05.054 --> 01:11:07.348
<i>Don't! Boys, no!</i>

961
01:11:07.515 --> 01:11:08.516
Don't go in there!

962
01:11:08.683 --> 01:11:10.143
Shh. You're safe.

963
01:11:10.309 --> 01:11:12.478
You're safe. Are you okay?

964
01:11:12.645 --> 01:11:13.980
Get off me, woman!

965
01:11:14.147 --> 01:11:15.690
Stop making a fuss!

966
01:11:16.023 --> 01:11:17.191
God!

967
01:11:21.279 --> 01:11:23.656
He sees ghosts.

968
01:11:28.661 --> 01:11:29.745
You're going to get cold.

969
01:11:29.912 --> 01:11:31.038
Oh, I don't...

970
01:11:31.497 --> 01:11:33.875
Don't worry about Charlie.
He doesn't mean anything by it.

971
01:11:49.307 --> 01:11:51.476
<i>Get out of there, now.
We've got to move!</i>

972
01:11:51.642 --> 01:11:54.061
You bloody animal, move!
Go on! Get on!

973
01:11:54.228 --> 01:11:56.189
These animals,
why are they hurting them?

974
01:11:56.355 --> 01:11:58.357
Because they need to move, quick!

975
01:11:58.524 --> 01:12:00.193
- Like us!
- But this is not the way.

976
01:12:00.902 --> 01:12:02.445
I could help them.

977
01:12:02.653 --> 01:12:03.905
<i>There's no time. Come on, woman!</i>

978
01:12:07.074 --> 01:12:08.201
Mama!

979
01:12:12.997 --> 01:12:14.916
That man... He's wounded.

980
01:12:15.082 --> 01:12:17.126
<i>There is nothing you can do
about it, Diana.</i>

981
01:12:17.293 --> 01:12:18.836
<i>We must keep moving!</i>

982
01:12:39.857 --> 01:12:41.108
What is this?

983
01:12:41.275 --> 01:12:43.319
You wanted me to take you to the war.
This is it.

984
01:12:43.486 --> 01:12:44.862
So, where are the Germans?

985
01:12:45.029 --> 01:12:47.448
A couple hundred yards across the field.

986
01:12:47.615 --> 01:12:48.950
- Their trench is...
- Watch out!

987
01:12:51.577 --> 01:12:53.746
Chief! It's good to see you!

988
01:12:53.913 --> 01:12:56.123
<i>Oi! Chief's back! He's back!</i>

989
01:12:57.583 --> 01:12:58.751
All right, let's move!

990
01:13:14.559 --> 01:13:17.144
- Diana, we have to go.
- We need to help these people.

991
01:13:17.311 --> 01:13:18.312
We have to stay on-mission.

992
01:13:18.479 --> 01:13:19.814
The next safe crossing
is at least a day away.

993
01:13:19.981 --> 01:13:22.400
- What are we waiting for?
- We cannot leave without helping them.

994
01:13:22.567 --> 01:13:24.151
These people are dying.

995
01:13:24.318 --> 01:13:25.987
They have nothing to eat,
and in the village...

996
01:13:26.153 --> 01:13:27.572
- Enslaved, she said!
- I understand that.

997
01:13:27.738 --> 01:13:28.739
Women and children!

998
01:13:28.906 --> 01:13:30.116
We need to make
our next position by sundown.

999
01:13:30.283 --> 01:13:32.451
How can you say that?
What is the matter with you?

1000
01:13:32.618 --> 01:13:34.662
This is No Man's Land, Diana!

1001
01:13:35.246 --> 01:13:37.123
It means no man can cross it,
all right?

1002
01:13:37.290 --> 01:13:39.625
This battalion has been here
for nearly a year

1003
01:13:39.792 --> 01:13:42.169
and they barely gained an inch.

1004
01:13:42.336 --> 01:13:45.631
Because, on the other side,
there are a bunch of Germans

1005
01:13:45.798 --> 01:13:47.967
pointing machine guns at
every square inch of this place.

1006
01:13:48.134 --> 01:13:50.386
This is not something you can cross.
It's not possible.

1007
01:13:50.553 --> 01:13:51.929
So what? So, we do nothing?

1008
01:13:52.096 --> 01:13:53.848
No, we are doing something.
We are.

1009
01:13:54.015 --> 01:13:55.308
- We just...
- Steve.

1010
01:13:55.474 --> 01:13:56.892
We can't save everyone in this war.

1011
01:13:57.059 --> 01:13:58.269
<i>Steve, Steve...</i>

1012
01:13:58.978 --> 01:14:00.396
This is not what we came here to do.

1013
01:14:16.495 --> 01:14:17.496
No,

1014
01:14:17.663 --> 01:14:19.665
but it's what I'm going to do.

1015
01:14:34.889 --> 01:14:36.223
Diana!

1016
01:14:58.412 --> 01:15:00.706
What the bloody hell is she playing at?

1017
01:15:17.098 --> 01:15:19.475
She's taking all the fire!
Let's go!

1018
01:15:22.978 --> 01:15:25.064
Stay down! Stay down!

1019
01:15:25.231 --> 01:15:26.607
<i>That's an order!</i>

1020
01:16:19.827 --> 01:16:20.661
Go, now!

1021
01:16:20.828 --> 01:16:22.747
<i>She's done it!
She's got them on the run!</i>

1022
01:16:26.625 --> 01:16:28.836
Get down, get down! She's done it!

1023
01:16:42.558 --> 01:16:43.976
Steve!

1024
01:16:44.185 --> 01:16:45.269
Let's go!

1025
01:16:48.063 --> 01:16:49.774
Come on, go!

1026
01:17:10.044 --> 01:17:11.629
Stay here. I'll go ahead.

1027
01:17:47.248 --> 01:17:48.624
- What the...
- Let's move!

1028
01:18:26.954 --> 01:18:28.455
<i>We need more firepower.</i>

1029
01:19:44.573 --> 01:19:45.658
Sniper!

1030
01:19:45.824 --> 01:19:47.117
Go!

1031
01:19:49.328 --> 01:19:50.329
Get in!

1032
01:19:50.496 --> 01:19:51.956
Charlie, bell tower!

1033
01:20:00.172 --> 01:20:01.173
<i>Come on, Charlie. Shoot him!</i>

1034
01:20:02.424 --> 01:20:04.385
Hey, it's okay.

1035
01:20:06.720 --> 01:20:07.721
<i>Huh.</i>

1036
01:20:09.515 --> 01:20:11.517
Follow me! Give me some cover!

1037
01:20:17.690 --> 01:20:19.400
Right!

1038
01:20:19.566 --> 01:20:22.277
We're going to put this on our backs,
and, when I say go,

1039
01:20:22.444 --> 01:20:23.404
- lift hard!
- Okay.

1040
01:20:24.446 --> 01:20:26.323
<i>Diana! Shield!</i>

1041
01:20:30.411 --> 01:20:31.912
Go!

1042
01:21:33.599 --> 01:21:35.642
<i>Stay very,
very still for me, my friends.</i>

1043
01:21:35.809 --> 01:21:37.436
<i>Please. So important.</i>

1044
01:21:41.148 --> 01:21:42.441
Thank you very much.

1045
01:21:42.608 --> 01:21:45.319
This has been such an honor for me,
taking your photograph.

1046
01:21:45.486 --> 01:21:46.528
Thank you so much.

1047
01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:55.245
<i>For all his talk of shooting,</i>

1048
01:21:55.412 --> 01:21:56.997
he cannot shoot.

1049
01:22:00.084 --> 01:22:02.628
Not everyone gets to be
what they want to be all the time.

1050
01:22:03.170 --> 01:22:05.589
Me, I am an actor.

1051
01:22:05.756 --> 01:22:07.132
I love acting.

1052
01:22:07.299 --> 01:22:09.009
I didn't want to be a soldier.

1053
01:22:10.177 --> 01:22:11.637
But I'm the wrong color.

1054
01:22:12.596 --> 01:22:14.932
Everyone is fighting their own battles,
Diana.

1055
01:22:16.350 --> 01:22:17.810
Just as you are fighting yours.

1056
01:22:24.024 --> 01:22:25.651
It's too much.
I wish you well.

1057
01:22:25.818 --> 01:22:26.819
Thank you, thank you.

1058
01:22:30.989 --> 01:22:32.533
I'm on the... On the phone--

1059
01:22:33.033 --> 01:22:35.536
Uh, it's "Veld." V-E-L-D.

1060
01:22:35.702 --> 01:22:37.246
It's a tiny village.

1061
01:22:37.412 --> 01:22:39.206
<i>It may not even be on the map.</i>

1062
01:22:39.373 --> 01:22:40.707
Ooh! I found it! I found it!

1063
01:22:41.250 --> 01:22:42.835
<i>Did you find Ludendorff's operation?</i>

1064
01:22:43.001 --> 01:22:44.837
No, no, no. But I located him.

1065
01:22:45.003 --> 01:22:47.464
And, oh, lucky you,
he's only a few miles away,

1066
01:22:47.631 --> 01:22:49.466
at German High Command.

1067
01:22:49.883 --> 01:22:51.552
<i>German High Command, huh?</i>

1068
01:22:51.718 --> 01:22:53.345
So, intel reports

1069
01:22:53.512 --> 01:22:55.681
<i>that Ludendorff is hosting a gala.</i>

1070
01:22:55.848 --> 01:22:57.224
<i>A sort of "last hurrah"</i>

1071
01:22:57.391 --> 01:22:59.685
before the Germans sign the armistice.

1072
01:22:59.852 --> 01:23:02.563
And the <i>Kaiser</i> himself
is going to be there.

1073
01:23:03.063 --> 01:23:05.607
As well as Dr. Maru.

1074
01:23:06.233 --> 01:23:07.693
Actually, the gala could be perfect cover.

1075
01:23:07.860 --> 01:23:09.570
<i>- Captain Trevor.</i>
- Yes, sir.

1076
01:23:09.736 --> 01:23:12.322
<i>You are, under no circumstances,
to go anywhere near</i>

1077
01:23:12.489 --> 01:23:14.533
that gala tomorrow night.
Do you hear me?

1078
01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:16.702
<i>You'd be jeopardizing
everything we've worked for.</i>

1079
01:23:16.869 --> 01:23:19.204
<i>You cannot compromise the armistice.</i>

1080
01:23:19.371 --> 01:23:20.998
- Sir, there will be no armistice...
- Steve!

1081
01:23:21.165 --> 01:23:23.000
...once Ludendorff bombs
the entire front line.

1082
01:23:23.167 --> 01:23:24.168
Hold on one second, sir.

1083
01:23:24.334 --> 01:23:26.211
You shouldn't be bothered
about upsetting the peace accord.

1084
01:23:26.378 --> 01:23:28.213
- Why not?
- Ares would never let...

1085
01:23:28.672 --> 01:23:29.673
What?

1086
01:23:30.215 --> 01:23:31.216
What is it?

1087
01:23:31.758 --> 01:23:33.719
Of course. It makes complete sense.

1088
01:23:35.220 --> 01:23:38.307
Ares developed a weapon,
the worst ever devised.

1089
01:23:38.473 --> 01:23:40.225
- Ares? You mean Ludendorff.
- No.

1090
01:23:40.767 --> 01:23:42.186
I mean Ares.

1091
01:23:42.769 --> 01:23:44.188
Ludendorff is Ares!

1092
01:23:45.814 --> 01:23:47.566
Sir, this is our last chance,

1093
01:23:47.733 --> 01:23:49.484
our final chance
to find out where the gas is

1094
01:23:49.651 --> 01:23:51.445
and to learn how Ludendorff
plans on delivering it.

1095
01:23:51.612 --> 01:23:53.363
No, no, no. I forbid it.

1096
01:23:53.530 --> 01:23:54.740
Do you hear me? I forbid it.

1097
01:23:54.907 --> 01:23:56.783
Sir, I'm losing you! Sir?

1098
01:23:56.950 --> 01:23:57.951
<i>- Hello?</i>
- Sir...

1099
01:24:01.246 --> 01:24:02.956
How likely is he to respect my wishes?

1100
01:24:03.123 --> 01:24:05.292
Not very likely, I'll be honest.

1101
01:24:11.590 --> 01:24:13.258
Sammy. Sammy, no. No, no, no.

1102
01:24:13.425 --> 01:24:15.302
Sammy, I have to work.

1103
01:24:15.469 --> 01:24:16.637
I gotta rustle up a German uniform.

1104
01:24:16.803 --> 01:24:18.096
I still have to plot the course
for tomorrow.

1105
01:24:18.263 --> 01:24:19.890
That's easy, boss. Come on.

1106
01:24:20.057 --> 01:24:21.433
There is nothing we can do until tomorrow.

1107
01:24:21.600 --> 01:24:22.643
You said it yourself, Steve.

1108
01:24:22.809 --> 01:24:24.811
So<i>... Madame, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1109
01:24:24.978 --> 01:24:25.979
<i>Incroyable!</i>

1110
01:24:26.730 --> 01:24:28.232
<i>Magnifique!</i>

1111
01:24:28.440 --> 01:24:29.441
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

1112
01:24:29.608 --> 01:24:30.817
<i>Monsieur, s'il vous plaît.</i>

1113
01:24:32.945 --> 01:24:34.363
<i>- Et voilà!</i>
- Merci, <i>Sammy.</i>

1114
01:24:34.529 --> 01:24:35.530
<i>Et voilà!</i>

1115
01:24:47.876 --> 01:24:49.169
You did this.

1116
01:24:51.463 --> 01:24:52.464
We did.

1117
01:24:57.427 --> 01:24:58.845
Do you have dancing on

1118
01:24:59.721 --> 01:25:01.014
Paradise Island?

1119
01:25:01.181 --> 01:25:02.975
Dancing, yeah. Of course.

1120
01:25:03.141 --> 01:25:07.187
But these people are just swaying.

1121
01:25:08.021 --> 01:25:11.400
Okay, if you're going to be fighting
the God of War,

1122
01:25:11.566 --> 01:25:14.528
I may as well teach you how to dance,
you poor thing.

1123
01:25:14.695 --> 01:25:17.364
All right, probably without the gun.

1124
01:25:17.531 --> 01:25:18.782
<i>Madame.</i>

1125
01:25:21.535 --> 01:25:23.078
If you would.

1126
01:25:23.745 --> 01:25:24.746
Well...

1127
01:25:26.498 --> 01:25:28.709
If I'm going to a gala,
I'll need to know how to dance.

1128
01:25:28.875 --> 01:25:30.585
- You're not going to the gala.
- Of course I am.

1129
01:25:30.752 --> 01:25:32.629
- No, you're not.
- Why wouldn't I?

1130
01:25:32.796 --> 01:25:34.798
Well, for one,
you don't know how to dance.

1131
01:25:35.340 --> 01:25:37.718
I would argue that
they don't know how to dance.

1132
01:25:37.884 --> 01:25:39.177
Be polite, be polite.

1133
01:25:41.888 --> 01:25:44.308
All right. So, give me your hand.

1134
01:25:44.474 --> 01:25:45.517
Like so.

1135
01:25:46.226 --> 01:25:49.438
And I'm gonna put my arm

1136
01:25:49.604 --> 01:25:51.356
around you, like so.

1137
01:25:52.024 --> 01:25:53.984
And we just...

1138
01:25:54.151 --> 01:25:55.610
What did you call it? "Sway"?

1139
01:25:55.777 --> 01:25:56.903
Then you just sway.

1140
01:25:57.487 --> 01:25:58.989
You're awfully close.

1141
01:26:01.116 --> 01:26:03.243
That's what it's all about.

1142
01:26:06.121 --> 01:26:07.331
I see.

1143
01:26:16.298 --> 01:26:18.550
I haven't heard him sing in years.

1144
01:26:35.067 --> 01:26:37.903
It's, uh... It's a snowfall.

1145
01:26:42.282 --> 01:26:43.283
Touch it.

1146
01:26:46.411 --> 01:26:47.913
It's magical!

1147
01:26:48.914 --> 01:26:50.624
It is, isn't it?

1148
01:26:52.667 --> 01:26:54.086
It is, yeah.

1149
01:27:00.634 --> 01:27:04.054
Is this what people do
when there are no wars to fight?

1150
01:27:04.763 --> 01:27:05.764
Yeah.

1151
01:27:07.057 --> 01:27:10.143
Yeah, this and other things.

1152
01:27:10.310 --> 01:27:11.728
What things?

1153
01:27:13.647 --> 01:27:14.648
Um...

1154
01:27:19.152 --> 01:27:20.654
They have breakfast.

1155
01:27:21.238 --> 01:27:22.864
They really love a breakfast.

1156
01:27:23.031 --> 01:27:25.575
And, um, they love to wake up

1157
01:27:26.535 --> 01:27:28.745
and read the paper and go to work.

1158
01:27:29.830 --> 01:27:31.581
They get married.

1159
01:27:32.207 --> 01:27:33.959
Make some babies,
grow old together.

1160
01:27:34.709 --> 01:27:35.794
I guess.

1161
01:27:39.756 --> 01:27:41.258
What is it like?

1162
01:27:45.262 --> 01:27:46.763
I have no idea.

1163
01:29:21.733 --> 01:29:23.151
The villagers gave them to us.

1164
01:29:24.069 --> 01:29:26.780
- A gracious gift.
- And they call us heroes.

1165
01:29:26.947 --> 01:29:27.948
You are.

1166
01:29:28.740 --> 01:29:30.534
Hey, fellas. I know that

1167
01:29:31.785 --> 01:29:33.453
I said this job was two days,

1168
01:29:35.664 --> 01:29:36.748
and a deal's a deal.

1169
01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:40.502
You'd get lost without us.

1170
01:29:41.419 --> 01:29:42.420
Yeah.

1171
01:29:43.213 --> 01:29:45.006
<i>We all know Diana is capable
of taking care of herself.</i>

1172
01:29:45.590 --> 01:29:47.175
I'm worried that you won't make it.

1173
01:29:47.342 --> 01:29:48.635
There's no more money.

1174
01:29:48.802 --> 01:29:50.220
We've been paid enough.

1175
01:29:50.804 --> 01:29:52.722
Maybe you're better off without me, yeah?

1176
01:29:53.723 --> 01:29:55.308
No, Charlie.

1177
01:29:56.768 --> 01:29:58.853
Who will sing for us?

1178
01:29:59.646 --> 01:30:01.773
<i>- Yeah.</i>
- Oh, no, please.

1179
01:30:02.649 --> 01:30:03.900
Sing?

1180
01:30:04.109 --> 01:30:05.819
You asked for it.

1181
01:30:05.986 --> 01:30:09.114
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1182
01:30:09.406 --> 01:30:12.993
<i>Green grow the rashes, O</i>

1183
01:30:13.159 --> 01:30:16.830
<i>The sweetest hours I e'er did spend</i>

1184
01:30:17.831 --> 01:30:20.000
You must think I was born yesterday.

1185
01:30:20.166 --> 01:30:22.043
I know it sounds crazy,
but it's true.

1186
01:30:22.210 --> 01:30:23.378
Every word.

1187
01:30:23.753 --> 01:30:25.130
Wait, wait, wait.

1188
01:30:25.297 --> 01:30:27.215
There is a whole island of women like her?

1189
01:30:27.382 --> 01:30:29.175
And not a single man among them?

1190
01:30:30.176 --> 01:30:31.428
How do we get there?

1191
01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:33.680
<i>And she thinks</i>

1192
01:30:33.847 --> 01:30:35.890
that Ludendorff is Ares, the God of War?

1193
01:30:36.057 --> 01:30:38.935
And only by killing him
will the war end? Don't be daft.

1194
01:30:39.102 --> 01:30:40.520
<i>You saw what happened out there.</i>

1195
01:30:41.021 --> 01:30:43.106
<i>The way she charged
that machine-gun nest?</i>

1196
01:30:43.273 --> 01:30:45.066
The way she took out that tower?

1197
01:30:46.568 --> 01:30:47.902
Maybe it's true.

1198
01:30:49.070 --> 01:30:50.405
I think it's true.

1199
01:30:50.864 --> 01:30:51.906
I believe it's true.

1200
01:30:52.073 --> 01:30:53.074
<i>Et voilà.</i>

1201
01:30:53.241 --> 01:30:57.037
Steven, son, you don't really believe
this rubbish, do you?

1202
01:31:20.226 --> 01:31:22.562
Diana! Diana!
Hiding, hiding.

1203
01:31:24.397 --> 01:31:25.815
How the hell do we get into that?

1204
01:31:26.900 --> 01:31:29.653
I see only a couple of guards
on the door to distract.

1205
01:31:29.861 --> 01:31:31.237
Yeah, it won't look suspicious at all

1206
01:31:31.404 --> 01:31:32.906
when I come sauntering
out of the woods on foot.

1207
01:31:33.073 --> 01:31:34.074
I could get in.

1208
01:31:34.240 --> 01:31:35.742
You're not going in. It's too dangerous.

1209
01:31:35.909 --> 01:31:37.494
- Too dangerous?
- Yes, too dangerous.

1210
01:31:37.661 --> 01:31:38.745
And you're too distracting.

1211
01:31:38.912 --> 01:31:41.373
So, look, I'll go in there,
and follow them

1212
01:31:41.539 --> 01:31:43.958
to wherever they're working on the gas
or, better yet, where it is.

1213
01:31:44.167 --> 01:31:45.418
- Then I'm coming with you.
<i>- No, you're not!</i>

1214
01:31:45.585 --> 01:31:48.421
What you're wearing
isn't exactly undercover.

1215
01:31:48.588 --> 01:31:49.589
I don't know.

1216
01:31:49.756 --> 01:31:51.591
I would say she was pretty undercover
on that battlefield.

1217
01:31:51.758 --> 01:31:53.802
<i>We just...
We can't get you in, okay?</i>

1218
01:31:53.968 --> 01:31:55.387
So, I'll scout it out, report back, and--

1219
01:31:55.553 --> 01:31:57.430
But as long as he's still alive,
it doesn't--

1220
01:31:57.597 --> 01:32:00.058
You cannot go into German High Command
and kill anyone.

1221
01:32:00.225 --> 01:32:02.102
You just can't. You have to trust me.

1222
01:32:03.436 --> 01:32:05.271
- Oh, wow!
- Where did that come from?

1223
01:32:05.438 --> 01:32:07.482
Oh, can I drive it?
Please, let me drive it!

1224
01:32:07.649 --> 01:32:08.900
I'll be your chauffeur.

1225
01:32:09.067 --> 01:32:10.276
Come on, come on.

1226
01:32:11.027 --> 01:32:12.028
Stay put!

1227
01:32:12.862 --> 01:32:13.863
<i>Where did this come from?</i>

1228
01:32:14.030 --> 01:32:16.199
A field over there. It's full of them!

1229
01:32:20.787 --> 01:32:21.871
Chief, I say you and me scope out the area

1230
01:32:22.038 --> 01:32:23.581
in case we need to beat a hasty retreat.

1231
01:32:23.748 --> 01:32:26.126
- What do you say, Diana?
- Huh?

1232
01:32:30.630 --> 01:32:31.840
<i>Colonel.</i>

1233
01:32:35.802 --> 01:32:38.388
Steve, they have invitations.

1234
01:32:39.806 --> 01:32:42.183
Don't worry, play it cool.
You got this. You got this.

1235
01:32:46.479 --> 01:32:47.522
Your invitation, please.

1236
01:32:47.689 --> 01:32:48.690
<i>Dhanyavaad,</i> sahib.

1237
01:32:48.898 --> 01:32:50.483
The colonel and I wish for many blessings

1238
01:32:50.650 --> 01:32:52.736
and all manner of other things
to fall upon your head.

1239
01:32:52.902 --> 01:32:54.446
Your head must be empty.

1240
01:32:54.654 --> 01:32:56.531
He wants my invitation, you idiot.

1241
01:32:56.698 --> 01:32:57.866
I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

1242
01:32:58.032 --> 01:33:00.493
I must apologize
a thousand, thousand times, my master.

1243
01:33:00.702 --> 01:33:03.663
I make the most horrible,
the most unforgivable mistake.

1244
01:33:03.830 --> 01:33:04.956
I lost the colonel's invitation.

1245
01:33:05.123 --> 01:33:06.124
What?

1246
01:33:06.291 --> 01:33:09.002
Are you saying we drove all the way
through the mud and rain

1247
01:33:09.169 --> 01:33:10.754
- only for you to lose my invitation?
- I'm a snail.

1248
01:33:10.920 --> 01:33:12.005
No! I'm a bug.

1249
01:33:12.172 --> 01:33:14.048
Not even a bug.
I am the dung of a bug!

1250
01:33:14.215 --> 01:33:15.467
And you're right, master...

1251
01:33:16.176 --> 01:33:17.510
Blessing be upon us.

1252
01:33:28.229 --> 01:33:29.606
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

1253
01:33:29.773 --> 01:33:31.941
<i>I'm not going to spend
the entire evening out here,</i>

1254
01:33:32.108 --> 01:33:34.194
you stupid idiots! Move your cars!

1255
01:33:55.423 --> 01:33:56.925
What are you supposed to be?

1256
01:34:00.595 --> 01:34:02.222
What are you doing?

1257
01:34:27.038 --> 01:34:28.081
Excuse me.

1258
01:34:30.917 --> 01:34:32.252
I don't drink.

1259
01:34:40.426 --> 01:34:41.594
Have we met?

1260
01:34:41.761 --> 01:34:43.596
No, but I've been watching you.

1261
01:34:44.597 --> 01:34:46.057
Following your career, I mean.

1262
01:34:47.433 --> 01:34:49.936
<i>You are Dr. Isabel Maru.</i>

1263
01:34:50.103 --> 01:34:52.647
The most talented chemist
in the German Army.

1264
01:34:52.814 --> 01:34:54.440
I am a fan.

1265
01:35:05.326 --> 01:35:07.453
I hope I am not crossing a line.

1266
01:35:08.955 --> 01:35:11.374
I know you and General Ludendorff are

1267
01:35:11.541 --> 01:35:12.584
very close.

1268
01:35:12.750 --> 01:35:16.004
We work well together. Yes.

1269
01:35:16.838 --> 01:35:19.799
But having someone like me behind you,

1270
01:35:20.466 --> 01:35:22.093
I could provide a lot more.

1271
01:35:22.260 --> 01:35:24.137
And who are you?

1272
01:35:24.721 --> 01:35:28.683
A man who would show you appreciation
a genius like yourself deserves.

1273
01:35:35.148 --> 01:35:37.650
I love fire. Don't you?

1274
01:35:40.153 --> 01:35:41.821
It is like

1275
01:35:43.156 --> 01:35:45.283
a living act of entropy.

1276
01:35:45.450 --> 01:35:47.827
The ultimate weapon of destruction.

1277
01:35:48.745 --> 01:35:50.955
Reminding us that, in the end,

1278
01:35:51.456 --> 01:35:54.834
everything eventually
returns to the ash it came from.

1279
01:35:57.337 --> 01:35:59.797
There is something reassuring about it.

1280
01:36:05.094 --> 01:36:07.305
I see all of that in your eyes.

1281
01:36:10.767 --> 01:36:13.061
Perhaps you could show me
what you're working on.

1282
01:36:29.118 --> 01:36:30.620
<i>I hear it is...</i>

1283
01:36:32.872 --> 01:36:35.124
I hear it is extraordinary.

1284
01:36:35.917 --> 01:36:39.587
I appreciate your interest in my work,

1285
01:36:39.754 --> 01:36:42.048
<i>but I am loyal to General Ludendorff.</i>

1286
01:36:42.215 --> 01:36:43.216
<i>Besides,</i>

1287
01:36:43.758 --> 01:36:46.469
now I see your attention is

1288
01:36:49.639 --> 01:36:50.682
elsewhere.

1289
01:37:14.706 --> 01:37:16.582
Enjoying the party?

1290
01:37:18.584 --> 01:37:21.587
I confess, I'm not sure what it is
we're celebrating.

1291
01:37:21.754 --> 01:37:24.507
A German victory, of course.

1292
01:37:24.674 --> 01:37:25.675
Victory?

1293
01:37:25.842 --> 01:37:28.052
When I hear peace could be so close.

1294
01:37:28.261 --> 01:37:29.262
Peace?

1295
01:37:29.429 --> 01:37:31.556
There's only an armistice

1296
01:37:31.723 --> 01:37:33.725
in an endless war.

1297
01:37:33.891 --> 01:37:35.268
Thucydides.

1298
01:37:35.476 --> 01:37:37.437
Ah! You know your Ancient Greeks.

1299
01:37:37.603 --> 01:37:39.439
They understood

1300
01:37:39.605 --> 01:37:41.941
that war is a god.

1301
01:37:42.108 --> 01:37:43.776
A god that requires human sacrifice.

1302
01:37:43.943 --> 01:37:45.862
And in exchange,

1303
01:37:46.029 --> 01:37:47.780
war gives man purpose,

1304
01:37:48.364 --> 01:37:50.575
meaning, a chance to rise above

1305
01:37:50.742 --> 01:37:53.036
his petty, mortal, little self

1306
01:37:53.619 --> 01:37:54.912
and be courageous,

1307
01:37:55.663 --> 01:37:57.165
noble, better!

1308
01:37:58.166 --> 01:38:01.461
Only one of the many gods believed in that.

1309
01:38:01.878 --> 01:38:04.047
- Mmm.
- And he was wrong.

1310
01:38:05.256 --> 01:38:07.175
You know nothing of the gods.

1311
01:38:07.341 --> 01:38:08.551
<i>Herr</i> General.

1312
01:38:11.471 --> 01:38:13.014
Enjoy the fireworks.

1313
01:38:18.561 --> 01:38:19.645
What are you doing?

1314
01:38:19.812 --> 01:38:21.189
- Out of my way!
- Diana, look at me.

1315
01:38:21.355 --> 01:38:23.024
If you kill Ludendorff
before we find the gas,

1316
01:38:23.191 --> 01:38:24.400
we won't be able to stop anything.

1317
01:38:24.567 --> 01:38:25.568
I will stop Ares!

1318
01:38:25.735 --> 01:38:26.819
What if you're wrong?

1319
01:38:28.488 --> 01:38:30.156
What if there is no Ares?

1320
01:38:31.949 --> 01:38:33.326
You don't believe me.

1321
01:38:33.868 --> 01:38:35.536
I can't let you do this.

1322
01:38:36.120 --> 01:38:37.413
What I do is not up to you.

1323
01:38:44.212 --> 01:38:45.296
Diana!

1324
01:38:49.717 --> 01:38:50.968
<i>Diana...</i>

1325
01:38:51.135 --> 01:38:52.220
<i>It's the gas.</i>

1326
01:38:52.386 --> 01:38:54.430
The village... The village!

1327
01:38:57.391 --> 01:38:58.976
What are they cheering for?

1328
01:39:01.521 --> 01:39:02.688
Diana!

1329
01:39:05.108 --> 01:39:06.734
What did they fire?

1330
01:39:06.901 --> 01:39:07.902
The gas.

1331
01:39:08.069 --> 01:39:09.612
- It was Ludendorff.
- I saw him. He was in the tower.

1332
01:39:09.779 --> 01:39:11.948
Wherever he goes, you follow.

1333
01:39:12.532 --> 01:39:13.783
How will you find us?

1334
01:39:14.367 --> 01:39:15.576
I know how.

1335
01:40:33.362 --> 01:40:34.697
Diana!

1336
01:40:37.825 --> 01:40:40.494
They're dead. They're all dead.

1337
01:40:41.329 --> 01:40:42.955
I could have saved them.

1338
01:40:43.289 --> 01:40:45.666
I could have saved them
if it weren't for you.

1339
01:40:45.833 --> 01:40:47.793
You stopped me from killing Ares!

1340
01:40:48.336 --> 01:40:50.463
- No!
- Stay away from me!

1341
01:40:50.630 --> 01:40:51.964
<i>I understand everything now.</i>

1342
01:40:52.131 --> 01:40:53.966
It isn't just the Germans
that Ares has corrupted.

1343
01:40:54.133 --> 01:40:55.301
It's you, too.

1344
01:40:55.927 --> 01:40:57.053
All of you.

1345
01:40:58.179 --> 01:40:59.555
I will find Ares

1346
01:40:59.722 --> 01:41:01.349
and I will kill him.

1347
01:41:04.477 --> 01:41:05.478
Diana!

1348
01:41:06.771 --> 01:41:08.022
That smoke,

1349
01:41:09.023 --> 01:41:10.149
<i>it's the Chief!</i>

1350
01:41:10.316 --> 01:41:11.567
He followed Ludendorff.

1351
01:41:13.069 --> 01:41:14.654
Follow the smoke!

1352
01:41:40.805 --> 01:41:42.348
Hey! Diana, that way!

1353
01:41:58.739 --> 01:42:00.616
Come on! Let's go!

1354
01:42:22.179 --> 01:42:23.764
<i>What a surprise.</i>

1355
01:42:24.473 --> 01:42:25.683
Strange.

1356
01:42:26.976 --> 01:42:29.145
Unfortunately, I have another matter

1357
01:42:30.438 --> 01:42:31.439
to attend to.

1358
01:42:36.610 --> 01:42:38.904
What are you?

1359
01:42:39.071 --> 01:42:40.323
You will soon find out.

1360
01:43:14.732 --> 01:43:18.444
As magnificent as you are,
you are still no match for me.

1361
01:43:22.615 --> 01:43:24.408
We'll see about that.

1362
01:43:48.682 --> 01:43:50.810
I am Diana of Themyscira,

1363
01:43:52.520 --> 01:43:54.605
<i>daughter of Hippolyta,</i>

1364
01:43:55.481 --> 01:43:57.817
Queen of the Amazons.

1365
01:44:01.070 --> 01:44:03.823
And your wrath upon this world is over.

1366
01:44:20.631 --> 01:44:23.384
In the name of all
that is good in this world,

1367
01:44:23.551 --> 01:44:26.262
I hereby complete
the mission of the Amazons

1368
01:44:26.429 --> 01:44:28.264
by ridding this world of you

1369
01:44:28.431 --> 01:44:29.515
forever!

1370
01:45:36.749 --> 01:45:37.750
<i>Diana?</i>

1371
01:45:43.839 --> 01:45:45.090
Diana!

1372
01:45:49.261 --> 01:45:50.513
I killed him.

1373
01:45:52.097 --> 01:45:54.266
I killed him, but nothing stopped.

1374
01:45:56.435 --> 01:45:58.646
You kill the God of War,
you stop the war.

1375
01:45:58.812 --> 01:46:00.898
Exactly what we have to do now.

1376
01:46:01.065 --> 01:46:02.483
We need to stop the gas. Come on.

1377
01:46:02.650 --> 01:46:03.943
No. All of this should have stopped!

1378
01:46:04.109 --> 01:46:05.110
Diana...

1379
01:46:05.277 --> 01:46:07.112
The fighting should have stopped.
Why are they doing this?

1380
01:46:07.279 --> 01:46:09.281
I don't know! I don't know.

1381
01:46:09.448 --> 01:46:11.116
Ares is dead.

1382
01:46:11.283 --> 01:46:13.494
They can stop fighting now.
Why are they still fighting?

1383
01:46:13.661 --> 01:46:15.287
Because, maybe it's them!

1384
01:46:15.829 --> 01:46:16.830
Maybe...

1385
01:46:18.791 --> 01:46:21.418
Maybe people aren't always good.

1386
01:46:22.294 --> 01:46:24.171
Ares or no Ares,

1387
01:46:25.464 --> 01:46:28.842
maybe it's just who they are.

1388
01:46:31.679 --> 01:46:33.055
- Diana...
- No.

1389
01:46:33.222 --> 01:46:34.723
Diana, we can talk about this later.

1390
01:46:34.890 --> 01:46:35.975
- I need you to come with me.
- No. No.

1391
01:46:36.141 --> 01:46:38.060
After everything I saw, it can't be!

1392
01:46:38.227 --> 01:46:39.687
It cannot be!

1393
01:46:40.312 --> 01:46:42.064
They were killing each other.

1394
01:46:42.231 --> 01:46:44.984
Killing people they cannot see.
Children...

1395
01:46:45.150 --> 01:46:46.694
Children!

1396
01:46:46.902 --> 01:46:49.321
No, it had to be him.
It cannot be them!

1397
01:46:49.488 --> 01:46:51.907
Diana, people... I...

1398
01:46:52.074 --> 01:46:53.576
She was right.

1399
01:46:54.159 --> 01:46:55.160
My mother was right.

1400
01:46:55.327 --> 01:46:57.246
She said,
"The world of men do not deserve you."

1401
01:46:57.413 --> 01:46:59.290
They don't deserve our help, Steve.

1402
01:46:59.456 --> 01:47:01.584
- It's not about deserve!
- They don't deserve our help.

1403
01:47:01.750 --> 01:47:03.586
Maybe we don't!

1404
01:47:05.212 --> 01:47:07.464
But it's not about that.
It's about what you believe.

1405
01:47:08.507 --> 01:47:11.343
You don't think I get it
after what I've seen out there?

1406
01:47:13.512 --> 01:47:16.181
You don't think I wish I could tell you
that it was one bad guy to blame?

1407
01:47:17.057 --> 01:47:18.559
It's not!

1408
01:47:20.936 --> 01:47:22.563
We're all to blame.

1409
01:47:22.855 --> 01:47:23.856
I am not.

1410
01:47:25.399 --> 01:47:27.192
But maybe I am!

1411
01:47:31.155 --> 01:47:32.239
Please.

1412
01:47:32.406 --> 01:47:34.199
If you believe that this war should stop,

1413
01:47:34.366 --> 01:47:36.118
if you want to stop it,

1414
01:47:36.285 --> 01:47:38.537
help me stop it right now.

1415
01:47:40.247 --> 01:47:43.083
Because, if you don't,
they will kill thousands more.

1416
01:47:43.709 --> 01:47:45.669
Please, please come with me.

1417
01:47:45.836 --> 01:47:47.379
I have to go.

1418
01:47:52.926 --> 01:47:55.387
I have to go.

1419
01:48:07.232 --> 01:48:08.233
Hey! Hey!

1420
01:48:12.738 --> 01:48:14.156
- Where's Diana?
- We're on our own.

1421
01:48:14.323 --> 01:48:16.784
- What?
- What do you see, Charlie?

1422
01:48:17.493 --> 01:48:19.119
<i>Looks like a bunch of gas bombs</i>

1423
01:48:19.286 --> 01:48:21.914
but I can't see where they're taking them.

1424
01:48:22.081 --> 01:48:23.415
<i>How are we going to get in there?</i>

1425
01:48:24.083 --> 01:48:26.126
I've got an idea. Come on, guys.

1426
01:48:26.293 --> 01:48:27.419
Come on!

1427
01:48:41.266 --> 01:48:42.810
Who's there?

1428
01:48:55.489 --> 01:48:57.032
Sir Patrick.

1429
01:48:57.783 --> 01:49:02.121
You were right, Diana.
They don't deserve our help.

1430
01:49:03.288 --> 01:49:07.251
They only deserve destruction.

1431
01:49:08.293 --> 01:49:09.712
You...

1432
01:49:11.630 --> 01:49:13.632
You're him.

1433
01:49:17.052 --> 01:49:18.470
I am.

1434
01:49:19.054 --> 01:49:23.976
But I am not what you thought I was.

1435
01:49:44.121 --> 01:49:45.706
What is it?

1436
01:49:46.999 --> 01:49:48.417
The future.

1437
01:49:53.005 --> 01:49:55.174
I am not your enemy, Diana.

1438
01:49:57.009 --> 01:50:00.846
I am the only one who truly knows you.

1439
01:50:01.013 --> 01:50:05.434
And who truly knows them, as you now do.

1440
01:50:07.853 --> 01:50:11.690
They have always been,
and always will be

1441
01:50:11.857 --> 01:50:15.694
weak, cruel, selfish,

1442
01:50:15.861 --> 01:50:19.031
and capable of the greatest horrors.

1443
01:50:28.373 --> 01:50:29.875
All I ever wanted

1444
01:50:30.042 --> 01:50:35.005
was for the Gods to see how evil
my father's creation was.

1445
01:50:36.924 --> 01:50:38.634
But they refused.

1446
01:50:38.801 --> 01:50:40.052
I am Diana of Themyscira...

1447
01:50:40.219 --> 01:50:41.220
So I destroyed them.

1448
01:50:41.386 --> 01:50:43.388
...daughter of Hippolyta,

1449
01:50:43.555 --> 01:50:44.681
and I'm here to complete her--

1450
01:50:53.565 --> 01:50:54.817
The Godkiller...

1451
01:50:57.861 --> 01:50:59.780
My dear child,

1452
01:51:01.156 --> 01:51:03.659
that is not the Godkiller.

1453
01:51:06.161 --> 01:51:07.704
You are.

1454
01:51:10.415 --> 01:51:13.418
Only a god can kill another god.

1455
01:51:14.419 --> 01:51:18.340
Zeus left the child he had
with the Queen of the Amazons

1456
01:51:18.507 --> 01:51:20.592
as a weapon to use against me.

1457
01:51:20.759 --> 01:51:22.594
No. You liar.

1458
01:51:24.304 --> 01:51:26.765
I compel you to tell me the truth.

1459
01:51:29.101 --> 01:51:30.811
I am.

1460
01:51:56.962 --> 01:51:59.339
I am not the God of War, Diana.

1461
01:51:59.506 --> 01:52:02.217
I am the God of Truth.

1462
01:52:03.510 --> 01:52:05.012
Mankind

1463
01:52:05.637 --> 01:52:07.806
stole this world from us.

1464
01:52:10.475 --> 01:52:14.021
<i>They ruined it, day by day.</i>

1465
01:52:14.187 --> 01:52:18.358
<i>And I, the only one
wise enough to see it,</i>

1466
01:52:20.027 --> 01:52:22.779
<i>was left too weak to stop them.</i>

1467
01:52:23.488 --> 01:52:27.117
<i>All these years,
I have struggled alone,</i>

1468
01:52:27.284 --> 01:52:29.202
<i>whispering into their ears.</i>

1469
01:52:29.369 --> 01:52:34.207
<i>Ideas, inspiration for formulas,</i>

1470
01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:36.627
<i>weapons,</i>

1471
01:52:39.129 --> 01:52:41.632
but I don't make them use them.

1472
01:52:42.507 --> 01:52:44.593
They start these wars on their own.

1473
01:52:45.719 --> 01:52:49.514
<i>All I do is orchestrate an armistice
I know they cannot keep,</i>

1474
01:52:49.681 --> 01:52:52.225
<i>in the hope they will destroy themselves.</i>

1475
01:52:53.977 --> 01:52:56.021
<i>But it has never been enough.</i>

1476
01:52:57.689 --> 01:52:59.441
Until you.

1477
01:53:01.485 --> 01:53:05.739
<i>When you first arrived,
I was going to crush you.</i>

1478
01:53:06.239 --> 01:53:09.493
<i>But I knew that if only you could see</i>

1479
01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:12.496
what the other gods could not,

1480
01:53:14.873 --> 01:53:19.419
then you would join me,
and with our powers combined,

1481
01:53:19.586 --> 01:53:23.590
we could finally end all the pain,
all the suffering,

1482
01:53:23.757 --> 01:53:26.468
the destruction they bring.

1483
01:53:26.635 --> 01:53:31.932
And we could return this world
to the paradise it was before them.

1484
01:53:33.392 --> 01:53:35.018
<i>Forever.</i>

1485
01:53:37.896 --> 01:53:39.439
<i>I...</i>

1486
01:53:44.111 --> 01:53:46.989
I could never be a part of that.

1487
01:53:50.242 --> 01:53:52.869
My dear, I don't want to fight you.

1488
01:53:53.954 --> 01:53:55.330
<i>But, if I must...</i>

1489
01:54:04.798 --> 01:54:06.591
- Steve!
- Come on, let's go!

1490
01:54:07.300 --> 01:54:08.427
<i>Sammy, let's go!</i>

1491
01:54:09.052 --> 01:54:10.721
Get this plane out of here!

1492
01:54:40.667 --> 01:54:45.088
Oh, my dear, you have so much to learn.

1493
01:55:10.197 --> 01:55:12.532
Oh, my God!

1494
01:55:12.699 --> 01:55:13.992
What are we gonna do?

1495
01:55:15.827 --> 01:55:18.038
There's not much we can do,

1496
01:55:18.497 --> 01:55:19.998
if that's who I think it is.

1497
01:55:26.004 --> 01:55:27.923
But we can stop that plane.

1498
01:55:40.977 --> 01:55:43.021
<i>If we can get on the radio,</i>

1499
01:55:43.188 --> 01:55:45.065
we can ask Flying Corps to shoot her down.

1500
01:55:45.232 --> 01:55:48.360
No. If it crashes, it'll wipe everyone out
for 50 square miles!

1501
01:55:48.527 --> 01:55:49.528
We gotta ground it!

1502
01:55:49.694 --> 01:55:51.530
Bad news. It's on a timer.

1503
01:55:51.696 --> 01:55:54.074
If we ground it here,
it's the same thing.

1504
01:56:01.039 --> 01:56:02.833
Is it flammable, Chief?

1505
01:56:02.999 --> 01:56:06.378
Yeah, she said it's hydrogen.
It's flammable.

1506
01:56:13.426 --> 01:56:15.720
I need you guys to clear me a path
to that plane.

1507
01:56:15.887 --> 01:56:18.098
- No, Steve!
- Hey, Steve!

1508
01:56:19.391 --> 01:56:20.392
Come on!

1509
01:57:03.768 --> 01:57:05.562
Come on! This way! Steve!

1510
01:57:15.947 --> 01:57:17.157
- Go, Steve, come on.
- Go!

1511
01:57:17.949 --> 01:57:19.326
Steve!

1512
01:57:22.162 --> 01:57:24.122
- Go, Steve. Come on.
- Run, run!

1513
01:58:02.244 --> 01:58:05.664
Let's see what kind of god you really are.

1514
01:58:31.856 --> 01:58:34.526
<i>You will help me destroy them, Diana,</i>

1515
01:58:38.655 --> 01:58:40.532
<i>or you will die.</i>

1516
01:58:50.500 --> 01:58:52.752
<i>Come on, come on.
Let's go, go, go!</i>

1517
01:58:54.796 --> 01:58:57.048
- Move it, boys! Now!
- Let's go! Run!

1518
01:59:22.907 --> 01:59:25.618
Is that all you have to offer?

1519
01:59:41.843 --> 01:59:45.764
It is futile to imagine you can win.

1520
01:59:46.556 --> 01:59:48.183
Give up, Diana.

1521
01:59:48.350 --> 01:59:49.351
<i>Guys, I'm out.</i>

1522
01:59:52.354 --> 01:59:53.605
Chief! Anything left?

1523
01:59:53.772 --> 01:59:54.856
I got nothing.

1524
01:59:55.023 --> 01:59:56.066
- Anything!
<i>- No.</i>

1525
02:00:14.000 --> 02:00:15.168
Steve.

1526
02:01:01.548 --> 02:01:02.966
Steve...

1527
02:01:06.469 --> 02:01:08.847
No!

1528
02:01:43.798 --> 02:01:46.092
<i>Yes, Diana!</i>

1529
02:01:46.259 --> 02:01:48.970
<i>Take them all!</i>

1530
02:01:49.137 --> 02:01:52.098
<i>Finally, you see.</i>

1531
02:01:52.724 --> 02:01:55.143
Look at this world.

1532
02:01:56.060 --> 02:01:58.855
<i>Mankind did this, not me.</i>

1533
02:02:00.064 --> 02:02:01.983
<i>They are ugly,</i>

1534
02:02:02.150 --> 02:02:04.235
<i>filled with hatred,</i>

1535
02:02:04.402 --> 02:02:05.653
<i>weak,</i>

1536
02:02:05.820 --> 02:02:08.907
<i>just like your Captain Trevor.</i>

1537
02:02:09.073 --> 02:02:11.910
Gone, and left you nothing.

1538
02:02:12.744 --> 02:02:14.913
<i>And for what?</i>

1539
02:02:15.330 --> 02:02:16.623
<i>Pathetic!</i>

1540
02:02:18.458 --> 02:02:19.751
He deserved to burn!

1541
02:02:30.762 --> 02:02:34.474
<i>Look at her and tell me I'm wrong.</i>

1542
02:02:43.608 --> 02:02:47.612
<i>She is the perfect example of these humans</i>

1543
02:02:49.405 --> 02:02:53.201
<i>and unworthy of your sympathy in every way.</i>

1544
02:02:54.452 --> 02:02:56.955
Destroy her, Diana.

1545
02:02:57.622 --> 02:03:01.042
<i>You know that she deserves it.
They all do.</i>

1546
02:03:04.629 --> 02:03:06.089
Do it!

1547
02:03:10.802 --> 02:03:12.470
<i>Diana!</i>

1548
02:03:15.848 --> 02:03:17.267
<i>Diana...</i>

1549
02:03:26.025 --> 02:03:27.026
What?

1550
02:03:28.152 --> 02:03:29.821
I have to go.

1551
02:03:32.532 --> 02:03:33.992
What are you saying?

1552
02:03:34.367 --> 02:03:35.368
Steve,

1553
02:03:36.035 --> 02:03:38.329
whatever it is, I can do it.

1554
02:03:38.496 --> 02:03:39.497
No. No.

1555
02:03:39.664 --> 02:03:41.291
- Let me do it.
- No.

1556
02:03:41.457 --> 02:03:43.001
It has to be me.

1557
02:03:43.167 --> 02:03:44.961
It has to be me.

1558
02:03:45.128 --> 02:03:48.131
I can save today.
You could save the world.

1559
02:03:56.973 --> 02:03:59.601
I wish we had more time.

1560
02:04:00.184 --> 02:04:02.687
What? What are you saying?

1561
02:04:05.356 --> 02:04:06.524
I love you!

1562
02:04:18.536 --> 02:04:19.829
You're wrong about them.

1563
02:04:29.756 --> 02:04:31.507
They're everything you say,

1564
02:04:32.258 --> 02:04:34.010
but so much more.

1565
02:04:34.177 --> 02:04:35.553
Lies!

1566
02:05:01.788 --> 02:05:05.416
They do not deserve your protection!

1567
02:05:07.210 --> 02:05:08.378
It's not about deserve.

1568
02:05:13.257 --> 02:05:15.176
It's about what you believe.

1569
02:05:18.429 --> 02:05:19.931
And I believe in love.

1570
02:05:20.098 --> 02:05:24.394
Then I will destroy you!

1571
02:05:52.296 --> 02:05:53.965
Goodbye, brother.

1572
02:09:26.218 --> 02:09:28.554
<i>I used to want to save the world.</i>

1573
02:09:29.722 --> 02:09:33.476
<i>To end war and bring peace to mankind.</i>

1574
02:09:34.060 --> 02:09:37.897
<i>But then I glimpsed the darkness
that lives within their light</i>

1575
02:09:38.814 --> 02:09:41.150
<i>and learned that inside every one of them,</i>

1576
02:09:41.734 --> 02:09:43.986
<i>there will always be both.</i>

1577
02:09:44.862 --> 02:09:47.740
<i>A choice each must make for themselves.</i>

1578
02:09:47.907 --> 02:09:51.327
<i>Something no hero will ever defeat.</i>

1579
02:09:53.037 --> 02:09:54.038
<i>And now I know</i>

1580
02:09:54.997 --> 02:09:59.627
<i>that only love can truly save the world.</i>

1581
02:10:01.504 --> 02:10:03.172
<i>So, I stay,</i>

1582
02:10:03.339 --> 02:10:05.508
<i>I fight, and I give,</i>

1583
02:10:08.260 --> 02:10:10.262
<i>for the world I know can be.</i>

1584
02:10:15.017 --> 02:10:16.227
<i>This is my mission now.</i>

1585
02:10:19.605 --> 02:10:20.940
<i>Forever.</i>
