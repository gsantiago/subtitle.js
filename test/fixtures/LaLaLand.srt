00:00:30,901 --> 00:00:33,000
Overnight lows of 75. [...]

5
00:01:05,401 --> 00:01:07,300
<i>Ba-ba-da ba-da ba-da-ba-ba</i>

6
00:01:07,401 --> 00:01:09,200
<i>Ba-ba-da ba-da ba-da-ba-ba</i>

7
00:01:09,301 --> 00:01:11,100
<i>Ba-ba-da ba-da ba-da-ba-ba</i>

8
00:01:11,201 --> 00:01:12,600
<i>Ba-ba-ba</i>

9
00:01:12,701 --> 00:01:14,800
<i>I think about that day</i>

10
00:01:14,801 --> 00:01:17,000
<i>I left him
at a Greyhound station</i>

11
00:01:17,001 --> 00:01:18,500
<i>west of Santa Fe</i>

12
00:01:18,501 --> 00:01:22,200
<i>We were seventeen,
but he was sweet and it was true</i>

13
00:01:22,301 --> 00:01:25,900
<i>Still I did
what I had to do</i>

14
00:01:25,901 --> 00:01:28,000
<i>'Cause I just knew</i>

15
00:01:28,101 --> 00:01:29,800
<i>Summer, sunday nights</i>

16
00:01:29,801 --> 00:01:33,600
<i>We'd sink into our seats
right as they dimmed out all the lights</i>

17
00:01:33,701 --> 00:01:37,500
<i>A Technicolor world made out
of music and machine,</i>

18
00:01:37,601 --> 00:01:41,200
<i>It called me
to be on that screen</i>

19
00:01:41,201 --> 00:01:43,200
<i>And live inside each scene</i>

20
00:01:43,201 --> 00:01:47,300
<i>Without a nickel to my name,
Hopped a bus, here I came</i>

21
00:01:47,401 --> 00:01:49,500
<i>Could be brave
or just insane,</i>

22
00:01:49,501 --> 00:01:51,000
<i>We'll have to see</i>

23
00:01:51,001 --> 00:01:52,900
<i>'Cause maybe
in that sleepy town</i>

24
00:01:53,001 --> 00:01:54,800
<i>He'll sit one day,
the lights are down,</i>

25
00:01:54,901 --> 00:01:58,700
<i>He'll see my face and think
of how he used to know me</i>

26
00:01:58,801 --> 00:02:02,100
<i>Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights</i>

27
00:02:02,201 --> 00:02:06,000
<i>And chasing
all the lights that shine</i>

28
00:02:06,101 --> 00:02:09,900
<i>And when they let you down,
(It's another day of...)</i>

29
00:02:10,001 --> 00:02:13,700
<i>You get up off the ground,
(It's another day of...)</i>

30
00:02:13,801 --> 00:02:20,800
<i>'Cause morning rolls around
and it's another day of sun</i>

31
00:02:21,401 --> 00:02:23,400
<i>I hear'em ev'ry day,</i>

32
00:02:23,401 --> 00:02:27,000
<i>The rhythms in the canyons
that'll never fade away,</i>

33
00:02:27,101 --> 00:02:30,800
<i>The ballads in the barrooms
left by those who came before</i>

34
00:02:30,901 --> 00:02:34,400
<i>They say
"you gotta want it more"</i>

35
00:02:34,401 --> 00:02:36,600
<i>So I bang on ev'ry door</i>

36
00:02:36,601 --> 00:02:38,700
<i>And even
when the answer's "no"</i>

37
00:02:38,801 --> 00:02:40,600
<i>Or when my money's
running low,</i>

38
00:02:40,701 --> 00:02:42,900
<i>The dusty mic
and neon glow</i>

39
00:02:42,901 --> 00:02:44,300
<i>Are all I need</i>

40
00:02:44,301 --> 00:02:46,300
<i>And someday,
as I sing my song,</i>

41
00:02:46,401 --> 00:02:48,300
<i>A small-town kid'll
come along</i>

42
00:02:48,401 --> 00:02:52,100
<i>That'll be the thing to push him on
and go, go</i>

43
00:02:52,201 --> 00:02:55,600
<i>Climb these hills
I'm reaching for the heights</i>

44
00:02:55,701 --> 00:02:59,400
<i>And chasing
all the lights that shine</i>

45
00:02:59,501 --> 00:03:03,200
<i>And when they let you down,
(It's another day of...)</i>

46
00:03:03,301 --> 00:03:07,100
<i>You get up off the ground,
('Cause it's another day of...)</i>

47
00:03:07,201 --> 00:03:14,200
<i>'Cause morning rolls around
and it's another day of sun</i>

48
00:03:45,401 --> 00:03:49,200
<i>And when they let you down,</i>

49
00:03:49,301 --> 00:03:52,200
<i>The morning rolls around</i>

50
00:03:52,201 --> 00:03:55,900
<i>It's another day of sun
(Oh)</i>

51
00:03:56,001 --> 00:03:59,800
<i>It's another day of sun
(Oh)</i>

52
00:03:59,901 --> 00:04:03,100
<i>It's another day of sun
(Sun [...])</i>

53
00:04:03,201 --> 00:04:06,800
<i>It's another day of sun
(Oh)</i>

54
00:04:06,901 --> 00:04:10,900
<i>Just another day of sun
(Oh)</i>

55
00:04:11,001 --> 00:04:14,600
<i>It's another day of sun
(Sun)</i>

56
00:04:14,701 --> 00:04:20,200
<i>Another day has just begun
(Oh)</i>

57
00:04:20,201 --> 00:04:22,900
<i>It's another day of sun</i>

58
00:04:39,201 --> 00:04:41,400
<i>It's another day of sun</i>

00:04:50,201 --> 00:04:53,200
WINTER

60
00:04:53,301 --> 00:04:55,800
[...] already has won three Oscars,

61
00:04:55,801 --> 00:05:00,600
including for the 1998 film
"Shakespeare in Love".

62
00:05:25,101 --> 00:05:28,700
[...] I mean, we could not
believe what was happening.

63
00:05:28,801 --> 00:05:32,700
No, I swear to God.
She was wrecked!

64
00:05:32,801 --> 00:05:36,000
She was completely wrecked!
I know!

65
00:05:36,101 --> 00:05:40,400
I know, it-it was...
it was pure insanity.

66
00:05:40,401 --> 00:05:42,800
"It's insanity?"

67
00:05:42,901 --> 00:05:44,300
Ah!

68
00:05:44,401 --> 00:05:47,800
Lunacy! "It was pure lunacy."

69
00:05:57,501 --> 00:06:00,000
What is his problem?
I should go.

70
00:06:07,801 --> 00:06:10,200
- Cappuccino, please.
- Right, of course.

71
00:06:10,301 --> 00:06:14,400
- On us.
- Oh! No, thank you. I insist.

72
00:06:25,601 --> 00:06:28,600
Did you see who that was?

73
00:06:43,501 --> 00:06:44,800
Audition!

74
00:06:45,601 --> 00:06:47,000
Shit.

75
00:06:47,301 --> 00:06:48,700
Mia, where d'you think
you're going?

76
00:06:48,701 --> 00:06:50,000
Oh. To see a doctor.

77
00:06:50,001 --> 00:06:51,700
You better be here
early tomorrow.

78
00:06:51,701 --> 00:06:53,100
Okay.

79
00:06:53,801 --> 00:06:55,700
Have a good night!

80
00:07:09,401 --> 00:07:11,900
She was wrecked!

81
00:07:11,901 --> 00:07:13,900
It was pure lunacy!
It was...

82
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:16,800
It was so crazy and I just...

83
00:07:16,901 --> 00:07:19,300
Oh, you would've died.

84
00:07:20,301 --> 00:07:24,400
No, Turner's fine. Turner's fine.
I-I just, uh...

85
00:07:25,201 --> 00:07:28,800
Are you going to wait until Denver
to tell her, or...?

86
00:07:31,801 --> 00:07:33,600
What?

87
00:07:42,301 --> 00:07:44,200
Okay.

88
00:07:48,701 --> 00:07:51,100
No, I'm happy for you.

89
00:07:53,101 --> 00:07:55,800
I am, I'm happy for you.
I just...

90
00:07:58,201 --> 00:08:00,400
I just thought...

91
00:08:03,501 --> 00:08:05,100
- I don't know what I thought.
- One second.

92
00:08:05,101 --> 00:08:06,100
I guess it just [...]

93
00:08:07,901 --> 00:08:10,500
- What, Ruby?
- Jessica on the phone.

94
00:08:10,601 --> 00:08:14,900
- Uh... Tell her I'll call her back.
- In two minutes?

95
00:08:15,201 --> 00:08:16,300
Less than two minutes.

96
00:08:16,301 --> 00:08:19,500
- I'll go get your lunch.
- I'm almost done. Thank you.

97
00:08:27,301 --> 00:08:30,000
Oh. You know what?
I think we're good.

98
00:08:30,001 --> 00:08:31,900
Thanks for coming in.

99
00:09:34,701 --> 00:09:37,800
Wow! Holy shit!
You wanna open a window?

100
00:09:37,901 --> 00:09:39,500
It was trying to give you
an entrance.

101
00:09:39,501 --> 00:09:40,800
Thank you.

102
00:09:40,901 --> 00:09:43,800
Mia! How'd the audition go?!

103
00:09:44,101 --> 00:09:45,800
- Er...
- Er, same here.

104
00:09:45,801 --> 00:09:47,200
Was Jen there? Or Rachel?

105
00:09:47,201 --> 00:09:48,900
I don't know
who Jen and Rachel are.

106
00:09:48,901 --> 00:09:50,100
Are the worst.

107
00:09:50,101 --> 00:09:52,100
Oh, I don't know
if they were there.

108
00:09:52,101 --> 00:09:53,200
Bet that they were.

109
00:09:53,201 --> 00:09:55,300
Why is there a convention
in the bathroom?

110
00:09:55,301 --> 00:09:56,300
Agreed.

111
00:09:56,301 --> 00:09:59,200
Two minutes, people!
Mia, you're coming, right?!

112
00:09:59,201 --> 00:10:00,700
I can't!

113
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:01,900
I'm working.

114
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,200
What?!

115
00:10:03,501 --> 00:10:05,800
Did she just say "working"?

116
00:10:07,101 --> 00:10:09,000
- What?
- I'm sorry it didn't go well today,

117
00:10:09,101 --> 00:10:10,400
and there's like four things
in my inbox

118
00:10:10,501 --> 00:10:12,300
that you're perfect for
and I will submit you.

119
00:10:12,301 --> 00:10:14,300
But right now, you're coming!

120
00:10:14,301 --> 00:10:16,500
- It will be fun.
- It's not gonna be fun.

121
00:10:16,601 --> 00:10:18,000
- It could be.
- It's not.

122
00:10:18,101 --> 00:10:20,000
It's gonna be a bunch
of social climbers,

123
00:10:20,101 --> 00:10:22,500
all packed into one
of those big glass houses.

124
00:10:22,501 --> 00:10:24,100
This looks familiar.

125
00:10:24,101 --> 00:10:26,500
- I was gonna give that back.
- How long have you had this?!

126
00:10:26,601 --> 00:10:28,500
- Oh, a long time.
- Come on, Mia!

127
00:10:28,601 --> 00:10:29,700
When else
are you gonna get to see

128
00:10:29,801 --> 00:10:32,200
a very Hollywood cliche
crammed into the same room?

129
00:10:32,201 --> 00:10:34,000
We'll make fun of it together!

130
00:10:34,001 --> 00:10:36,800
"I'm disappointed in you, Lex."
There's nothing to make fun of.

131
00:10:36,901 --> 00:10:39,700
This party is gonna be like...
humanity at its finest.

132
00:10:39,701 --> 00:10:40,700
Hmm.

133
00:10:40,701 --> 00:10:44,200
<i>- You got the invitation
- You got the right address</i>

134
00:10:44,301 --> 00:10:48,000
<i>- You need some medication?
- The answer's always yes</i>

135
00:10:48,001 --> 00:10:50,100
<i>A little chance encounter</i>

136
00:10:50,101 --> 00:10:52,500
<i>Could be the one
you've waited for</i>

137
00:10:52,501 --> 00:10:53,500
Oh!

138
00:10:53,601 --> 00:10:55,600
<i>Just squeeze a bit more!</i>

139
00:10:55,601 --> 00:10:59,200
<i>Tonight we're on a mission
Tonight's the casting call</i>

140
00:10:59,201 --> 00:11:01,200
<i>If this is the real audition</i>

141
00:11:01,301 --> 00:11:03,000
<i>Oh, God help us all!</i>

142
00:11:03,001 --> 00:11:08,200
<i>You make the right impression,
Then ev'rybody knows your name</i>

143
00:11:08,201 --> 00:11:10,400
<i>We're in the fast lane</i>

144
00:11:10,401 --> 00:11:14,000
<i>Someone in the crowd could be
the one you need to know,</i>

145
00:11:14,101 --> 00:11:17,800
<i>The one to fin'lly
lift you off the ground</i>

146
00:11:17,901 --> 00:11:21,300
<i>Someone in the crowd
could take you where you wanna go</i>

147
00:11:21,401 --> 00:11:23,900
<i>If you're the someone
ready to be found</i>

148
00:11:24,001 --> 00:11:26,400
<i>The someone
ready to be found</i>

149
00:11:26,501 --> 00:11:30,200
<i>Do what you need to do
'til they discover you</i>

150
00:11:30,301 --> 00:11:34,000
<i>And make you more
than who you're seeing now</i>

151
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:37,900
<i>- So with the stars aligned
- I think I'll stay behind</i>

152
00:11:37,901 --> 00:11:42,400
<i>You've got to go and find</i>

153
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:45,800
<i>That someone in the crowd</i>

154
00:12:11,701 --> 00:12:13,200
Hey girl!

155
00:12:13,301 --> 00:12:15,000
Uhuh.

156
00:12:15,301 --> 00:12:19,400
<i>That someone in the crowd!</i>

157
00:13:27,301 --> 00:13:30,800
<i>Is someone in the crowd</i>

158
00:13:30,801 --> 00:13:35,400
<i>the only thing
you really see?</i>

159
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:43,900
<i>Watching while the world
keeps spinning 'round?</i>

160
00:13:44,701 --> 00:13:53,300
<i>Somewhere there's a place
where I find who I'm gonna be,</i>

161
00:13:54,201 --> 00:13:56,300
<i>A somewhere</i>

162
00:13:56,301 --> 00:14:02,800
<i>that's just waiting
to be found</i>

163
00:14:49,001 --> 00:14:52,200

00:15:21,701 --> 00:15:25,000
Oh, come on! What...?

173
00:15:28,101 --> 00:15:30,000
Ah!

174
00:15:51,901 --> 00:15:56,000
STORAGE / ENTRANCE

175
00:16:49,701 --> 00:16:52,800
Lipton's / OPEN

176
00:17:55,601 --> 00:17:57,500
California oranges

177
00:18:00,901 --> 00:18:04,400
VAN BEEK - Tapas & Tunes

178
00:18:17,601 --> 00:18:19,200
Please stop sneaking
into my home.

179
00:18:19,301 --> 00:18:21,200
D'you think Mom and Dad
would call this a "home"?

180
00:18:21,201 --> 00:18:22,500
What're you doing?

181
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:24,500
Please don't do that.
Please don't sit on that.

182
00:18:24,601 --> 00:18:25,900
- Are you kidding?
- Please don't sit on that,

183
00:18:26,001 --> 00:18:27,400
don't sit on that.
Don't sit on that.

184
00:18:27,501 --> 00:18:29,200
- Hoagy Carmichael sat on that.
- Oh my God!

185
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:30,700
The Baked Potato
just threw it away.

186
00:18:30,701 --> 00:18:31,800
I can't imagine why.

187
00:18:31,801 --> 00:18:34,400
- And now you're just sitting on it.
- I got you a throw rug.

188
00:18:34,401 --> 00:18:35,700
I don't need that.

189
00:18:35,701 --> 00:18:38,400
What if I said
Miles Davis pissed on it?

190
00:18:38,401 --> 00:18:40,300
It's almost insulting.

191
00:18:40,401 --> 00:18:41,500
Is it true?

192
00:18:41,501 --> 00:18:44,100
When are you going
to unpack these boxes?!

193
00:18:44,201 --> 00:18:45,900
When I unpack them
in my own club.

194
00:18:45,901 --> 00:18:46,900
Oh, Sebastian!

195
00:18:46,901 --> 00:18:49,500
It's like a girl broke up
with you and you're stalking her.

196
00:18:49,601 --> 00:18:52,000
You're not still going by there,
are you?

197
00:18:52,001 --> 00:18:53,900
That's...

198
00:18:54,201 --> 00:18:56,000
Can't believe it, they turned it
into a samba-tapas place.

199
00:18:56,101 --> 00:19:00,000
- Oh my God, Sebastian!
- Samba, tapas.

200
00:19:00,101 --> 00:19:02,600
Pick one, you know?
Do one right.

201
00:19:02,701 --> 00:19:04,600
I have someone
I want you to meet.

202
00:19:04,601 --> 00:19:06,700
I don't want to meet anyone.

203
00:19:06,701 --> 00:19:07,500
No, no,
I don't want to meet anyone.

204
00:19:07,601 --> 00:19:08,700
- Dad gave you this?
- Yes.

205
00:19:08,701 --> 00:19:10,000
You'll like her.

206
00:19:10,101 --> 00:19:11,700
I don't think I'm gonna like her.

207
00:19:11,701 --> 00:19:13,500
- Does she like jazz?
- Probably not.

208
00:19:13,601 --> 00:19:15,000
Then what are we gonna
talk about?

209
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:16,500
I dont know! It doesn't matter,
okay?

210
00:19:16,601 --> 00:19:19,500
Because you're living like a hermit.
You're driving without insurance!

211
00:19:19,601 --> 00:19:21,100
- It doesn't matter?
- Yeah, it doesn't matter.

212
00:19:21,201 --> 00:19:22,500
- Okay.
- You need to get serious.

213
00:19:22,601 --> 00:19:24,600
Well, then I know a guy with
a face tattoo that you should see.

214
00:19:24,701 --> 00:19:26,400
- Okay, low blow.
- With a heart of gold.

215
00:19:26,501 --> 00:19:28,200
- Get serious!
- Get serious? Laura.

216
00:19:28,301 --> 00:19:31,900
I... I had a very serious plan
for my future.

217
00:19:31,901 --> 00:19:33,000
I know.

218
00:19:33,001 --> 00:19:34,400
It's not my fault
I got shanghaied!

219
00:19:34,501 --> 00:19:37,500
You didn't get shanghaied,
you got ripped off.

220
00:19:37,501 --> 00:19:38,800
What's the difference?

221
00:19:38,801 --> 00:19:41,900
I don't know!
It's not as romantic as that.

222
00:19:41,901 --> 00:19:43,500
Don't sit...

223
00:19:44,201 --> 00:19:47,500
Everybody knew that guy
was shady, except for you.

224
00:19:47,901 --> 00:19:51,400
Why do you say "romantic"
like it's a dirty word?

225
00:19:51,501 --> 00:19:55,500
Unpaid bills are not romantic.
Call her.

226
00:19:55,501 --> 00:19:56,700
I'm not going to call her.

227
00:19:56,701 --> 00:20:00,300
The thing is... y-you're acting like
life's got me on the ropes.

228
00:20:00,301 --> 00:20:02,400
I want to be on the ropes.

229
00:20:02,401 --> 00:20:04,900
Okay? I'm just... I'm letting
life hit me until it gets tired.

230
00:20:04,901 --> 00:20:05,900
Oh?

231
00:20:05,901 --> 00:20:09,500
Then I'm gonna hit back.
It's a classic "rope-a-dope".

232
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,300
Okay, Ali.

233
00:20:11,301 --> 00:20:13,200
I love you.
Unpack the boxes.

234
00:20:13,301 --> 00:20:16,400
- I'm gonna change the locks.
- You can't afford it.

235
00:20:17,101 --> 00:20:20,700
I'm a phoenix
rising from the ashes!

236
00:20:24,401 --> 00:20:25,600
PAST DUE

237
00:21:07,701 --> 00:21:09,100
- Hey.
- Hey Bill.

238
00:21:09,201 --> 00:21:10,800
- Thanks for letting me back.
- You're welcome.

239
00:21:10,901 --> 00:21:12,500
I want you to know
that you're looking at a new man.

240
00:21:12,501 --> 00:21:13,500
Good.

241
00:21:13,501 --> 00:21:15,000
- A man that's happy to be here.
- Excellent.

242
00:21:15,101 --> 00:21:16,600
- Very-easy-to-work-with man.
- Okay.

243
00:21:16,701 --> 00:21:18,300
And you're gonna...
play the setlist?

244
00:21:18,301 --> 00:21:19,800
Happy to.

245
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:21,700
Even though I don't think
anybody cares what I play,

246
00:21:21,801 --> 00:21:23,200
- but yeah.
- Yep. Well,

247
00:21:23,301 --> 00:21:25,500
if by "anyone" you mean
anyone other than me,

248
00:21:25,501 --> 00:21:26,500
that would be correct.

249
00:21:26,501 --> 00:21:28,000
I care, and I don't wanna hear
the free jazz.

250
00:21:28,001 --> 00:21:30,300
Right. Okay.

251
00:21:30,301 --> 00:21:32,100
Although I-I... I thought
that in this town

252
00:21:32,201 --> 00:21:35,400
it worked on a sort of "one
for you, one for me" type system.

253
00:21:35,801 --> 00:21:38,200
How about two for you,
one for me?

254
00:21:38,601 --> 00:21:40,500
How 'bout... all for you
and none for me?

255
00:21:40,601 --> 00:21:42,000
- That's perfect. Yes.
- Great.

256
00:21:42,101 --> 00:21:43,600
- Okay.
- Okay. Mutual decision.

257
00:21:43,701 --> 00:21:45,700
- Right. Made-Made by me.
- Right.

258
00:21:45,701 --> 00:21:47,500
And I... signed off on it, so...

259
00:21:47,501 --> 00:21:50,100
Whatever. Tell yourself
what you wanna know.

260
00:21:50,101 --> 00:21:53,000
Well, welcome back.

261
00:21:53,701 --> 00:21:56,400
There's a nice way
to say that, Karen.

262
00:24:59,201 --> 00:25:00,900
Seb.

263
00:25:12,801 --> 00:25:14,500
I do-I-I hear
what you're saying,

264
00:25:14,601 --> 00:25:15,800
but I don't think
you're saying what you mean.

265
00:25:15,901 --> 00:25:18,000
Yeah, I don't think you hear
what I'm saying. You're fired.

266
00:25:18,101 --> 00:25:20,100
Well, I-That's what you're saying,
but it's not what you mean.

267
00:25:20,101 --> 00:25:21,100
What you mean is...

268
00:25:21,201 --> 00:25:22,300
You're fired.

269
00:25:22,401 --> 00:25:24,500
..."play the setlist".

270
00:25:24,501 --> 00:25:25,700
No, I'm saying
it's too late.

271
00:25:25,701 --> 00:25:26,900
It's a warning.

272
00:25:26,901 --> 00:25:28,300
What-What planet
are you from?

273
00:25:28,401 --> 00:25:29,400
- Don't fire me.
- You're done.

274
00:25:29,501 --> 00:25:31,500
- Don't fire me.
- I'm sorry, Seb.

275
00:25:31,501 --> 00:25:32,800
It's Christmas.

276
00:25:32,801 --> 00:25:36,500
Yeah, I see the decorations.
Good luck in the New Year.

277
00:25:49,801 --> 00:25:52,000
I just heard you play,
and I wanted to...

278
00:26:06,501 --> 00:26:09,300
I don't like the fissure
on the GT scan.

279
00:26:09,301 --> 00:26:11,600
Did you test for achromatopsia?

280
00:26:11,601 --> 00:26:15,100
D.O.A. on 23rd. Perp
laughing his face off at the P.D.

281
00:26:15,101 --> 00:26:16,700
Damn Miranda Rights.

282
00:26:16,801 --> 00:26:18,800
This is my classroom.

283
00:26:18,801 --> 00:26:21,000
You don't like it,
the door's to my left.

284
00:26:21,101 --> 00:26:23,900
Lady, why you be trippin'
like that?

285
00:26:23,901 --> 00:26:26,000
No, Jamal.

286
00:26:26,401 --> 00:26:29,100
You be trippin'.

287
00:26:33,001 --> 00:26:37,500
SPRING

288
00:26:37,601 --> 00:26:39,600
Jump right here!

289
00:26:41,901 --> 00:26:45,100
<i>We're talking away</i>

290
00:26:45,101 --> 00:26:47,800
<i>I don't know
what I'm to say,</i>

291
00:26:47,801 --> 00:26:48,800
<i>I'll say it anyway</i>

292
00:26:48,901 --> 00:26:50,200
Oh. Mia!

293
00:26:50,201 --> 00:26:52,400
- Hi!
- Hi.

294
00:26:52,501 --> 00:26:54,200
I want you to meet
my friend Carlo.

295
00:26:54,301 --> 00:26:55,600
- Hi. Carlo.
- Carlo, this is Mia.

296
00:26:55,701 --> 00:26:57,100
- Nice. Mia?
- Yes, Mia.

297
00:26:57,201 --> 00:26:59,100
- Hi. How are you?
- Carlo is a writer.

298
00:26:59,201 --> 00:27:01,600
Yeah. They say I have a knack
for world-building.

299
00:27:01,601 --> 00:27:03,100
I-I got a lot of heat right now.

300
00:27:03,101 --> 00:27:05,400
There's been a lot of buzz, people
talkin' about me, which is exciting.

301
00:27:05,501 --> 00:27:07,000
I mean, you work so hard,
and then all that validation.

302
00:27:07,101 --> 00:27:08,100
- It's great...
- I'm gonna grab a drink.

303
00:27:08,201 --> 00:27:09,200
- Yeah.
- Okay.

304
00:27:09,301 --> 00:27:10,600
- Okay.
- It's really nice to meet you...

305
00:27:10,701 --> 00:27:21,300
<i>I'll be gone
in a day or two</i>

306
00:27:21,401 --> 00:27:26,300
<i>So needless to say
I'm odds and ends,</i>

307
00:27:26,301 --> 00:27:30,300
<i>But I'll be stumbling away,</i>

308
00:27:30,301 --> 00:27:33,500
<i>Slowly learning
that life is okay</i>

309
00:27:33,501 --> 00:27:36,200
<i>Say after me:</i>

310
00:27:36,201 --> 00:27:38,900
<i>"It's no better to be safe
than sorry"</i>

311
00:27:38,901 --> 00:27:44,500
<i>Take on me (Take on me)</i>

312
00:27:44,601 --> 00:27:50,200
<i>Take me on (Take on me)</i>

313
00:27:50,201 --> 00:28:01,300
<i>I'll be gone
in a day or two</i>

314
00:28:01,301 --> 00:28:02,500
Thank you.

315
00:28:02,601 --> 00:28:05,000
Any other requests?!

316
00:28:07,401 --> 00:28:08,900
Girl in the front!

317
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:10,000
"I Ran".

318
00:28:10,001 --> 00:28:13,600
"I Ran".
A fantastic suggestion!

319
00:28:13,701 --> 00:28:16,900
All right, piano man,
tickle those ivories. Let's hit it.

320
00:28:16,901 --> 00:28:19,600
One, two, three, four!

321
00:28:25,901 --> 00:28:27,200
Uh!

322
00:28:30,001 --> 00:28:31,500
That's right!

323
00:28:31,601 --> 00:28:34,800
<i>I walk alone the avenue</i>

324
00:28:34,801 --> 00:28:39,500
<i>I never thought I'd meet
a girl like you</i>

325
00:28:39,501 --> 00:28:42,000
<i>Meet a girl like you</i>

326
00:28:42,101 --> 00:28:43,800
(Me?)

327
00:28:44,501 --> 00:28:47,700
<i>With auburn hair
and tawny eyes,</i>

328
00:28:47,801 --> 00:28:52,200
<i>With kind of eyes
that hypnotize me through</i>

329
00:28:52,201 --> 00:28:56,400
<i>That hypnotize me through</i>

330
00:28:56,401 --> 00:29:02,300
<i>And I ran,
I ran so far away</i>

331
00:29:02,301 --> 00:29:04,900
<i>I couldn't get away</i>

332
00:29:15,201 --> 00:29:21,200
<i>Sometimes I feel
I've got to run away,</i>

333
00:29:21,201 --> 00:29:24,500
<i>I've got to get away</i>

334
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:29,800
<i>From the pain you drive
into the heart of me</i>

335
00:29:29,801 --> 00:29:31,800
All right. I remember you.

336
00:29:31,801 --> 00:29:34,600
And I'll admit I was
a little curt that night.

337
00:29:34,701 --> 00:29:36,500
- "Curt"?
- Okay, I was an asshole.

338
00:29:36,601 --> 00:29:38,400
- I can admit that.
- Okay.

339
00:29:38,501 --> 00:29:41,000
But requesting "I Ran"
from a serious musician

340
00:29:41,001 --> 00:29:42,200
is just... it's too far.

341
00:29:42,201 --> 00:29:45,800
My Lord! Did you just say
"a serious musician"?

342
00:29:45,801 --> 00:29:46,800
I don't think so.

343
00:29:46,801 --> 00:29:48,400
- Can I borrow what you're wearing?
- Why?

344
00:29:48,501 --> 00:29:49,700
'Cause I have an audition
next week.

345
00:29:49,801 --> 00:29:51,800
I'm playing
a serious firefighter.

346
00:29:51,801 --> 00:29:53,000
So you're an actress.

347
00:29:53,001 --> 00:29:55,600
I thought you looked familiar.
Have I seen you on anything?

348
00:29:55,701 --> 00:29:58,900
Uh... A coffee shop?
On the Warner Bros. lot?

349
00:29:59,001 --> 00:30:00,600
- That's classic.
- Oh, I see.

350
00:30:00,701 --> 00:30:01,800
- Yeah.
- You're a barista.

351
00:30:01,901 --> 00:30:04,000
And I can see how you could then
look down on me

352
00:30:04,001 --> 00:30:05,200
from all the way up there.

353
00:30:05,301 --> 00:30:07,200
Time to do the next set.

354
00:30:08,301 --> 00:30:10,100
He doesn't... I don't...

355
00:30:10,401 --> 00:30:11,900
He doesn't tell me
what to do.

356
00:30:12,001 --> 00:30:13,400
He just... told you
what to do...

357
00:30:13,401 --> 00:30:15,500
I know, he... I let him.

358
00:30:15,501 --> 00:30:16,900
- What's your name?
- Mia.

359
00:30:16,901 --> 00:30:18,400
Mia.

360
00:30:19,501 --> 00:30:21,800
Guess I'll see you
in the movies.

361
00:30:23,801 --> 00:30:25,600
- Heard of Joseph Campbell?
- Uh, yeah.

362
00:30:25,701 --> 00:30:27,200
I have this idea
to do a re-imagining

363
00:30:27,301 --> 00:30:30,000
of "Goldilocks and the Three Bears"
but from the perspective of the bears.

364
00:30:30,101 --> 00:30:32,200
It's kind of thrilling.
Yeah, it could be like a franchise.

365
00:30:32,301 --> 00:30:33,300
- Right.
- So we don't know.

366
00:30:33,401 --> 00:30:34,900
There could've been a fourth bear,
we don't know.

367
00:30:34,901 --> 00:30:36,800
George Michael!

368
00:30:42,001 --> 00:30:43,000
Hello.

369
00:30:43,001 --> 00:30:43,900
- Sorry.
- Yeah, yeah.

370
00:30:43,901 --> 00:30:45,300
It's... I know that guy.

371
00:30:45,401 --> 00:30:47,500
Did you get your keys?

372
00:30:49,001 --> 00:30:50,400
Mm-hmm. Yes.

373
00:30:50,501 --> 00:30:52,200
Can you grab mine?

374
00:30:52,301 --> 00:30:53,300
Can I what?

375
00:30:53,301 --> 00:30:54,500
Would you be able to grab mine?
My keys?

376
00:30:54,601 --> 00:30:55,600
- I can't hear you.
- Sorry.

377
00:30:55,701 --> 00:30:58,700
- Can-Can you grab my keys?
- Oh.

378
00:30:58,801 --> 00:31:00,000
- Please?
- Oh, there we go.

379
00:31:00,101 --> 00:31:02,400
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

380
00:31:04,101 --> 00:31:06,700
- What kind?
- It's a Prius.

381
00:31:08,501 --> 00:31:10,300
That mean the...
That does't help me.

382
00:31:10,301 --> 00:31:12,100
With a green ribbon.

383
00:31:12,201 --> 00:31:13,600
All right.

384
00:31:15,601 --> 00:31:18,700
Those look, uh, comfortable.

385
00:31:18,801 --> 00:31:20,600
They are.

386
00:31:21,401 --> 00:31:24,200
Thank you for saving the day
back there.

387
00:31:25,801 --> 00:31:29,300
Well, you didn't really give me
much of a choice.

388
00:31:29,401 --> 00:31:32,700
It's pretty strange that we keep
running into each other.

389
00:31:32,801 --> 00:31:36,700
It is strange.
Maybe it means something.

390
00:31:36,801 --> 00:31:38,100
- I doubt it.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

391
00:31:38,101 --> 00:31:40,000
Where's my car?!

392
00:31:40,401 --> 00:31:42,500
You gotta put that thing
to your chin.

393
00:31:42,601 --> 00:31:44,600
- This?
- Yeah.

394
00:31:45,001 --> 00:31:46,700
Yeah, it makes your head
into an antenna, so...

395
00:31:46,701 --> 00:31:47,700
Oh?

396
00:31:47,701 --> 00:31:49,300
I think it gives you cancer,
but you find your car faster.

397
00:31:49,301 --> 00:31:50,300
What?

398
00:31:50,301 --> 00:31:52,100
I mean, you don't live as long,
but you get where you're going quicker,

399
00:31:52,201 --> 00:31:54,300
- so it all evens out.
- That sounds terrible.

400
00:31:54,401 --> 00:31:56,900
- Just a suggestion.
- You're a...

401
00:31:57,201 --> 00:31:59,200
You're a real, uh...

402
00:31:59,201 --> 00:32:01,400
- What's the word am I looking for?
- Knight in shining armor?

403
00:32:01,501 --> 00:32:05,100
- Weirdo. That was the word.
- Okay.

404
00:32:11,501 --> 00:32:13,700
Not much to look at, huh?

405
00:32:14,001 --> 00:32:15,900
I've seen better.

406
00:32:23,401 --> 00:32:27,500
<i>The sun is nearly gone,</i>

407
00:32:27,601 --> 00:32:32,400
<i>The lights are turnin' on,</i>

408
00:32:32,401 --> 00:32:39,000
<i>A silver shine
that stretches to the sea</i>

409
00:32:40,301 --> 00:32:43,300
<i>We've stumbled on a view</i>

410
00:32:43,401 --> 00:32:48,800
<i>That's tailor-made for two</i>

411
00:32:48,801 --> 00:32:54,700
<i>What a shame those two
are you and me</i>

412
00:32:55,701 --> 00:33:00,500
<i>Some other girl and guy</i>

413
00:33:00,601 --> 00:33:03,400
<i>Would love this swirling sky,</i>

414
00:33:03,501 --> 00:33:07,600
<i>But there's only you and I</i>

415
00:33:07,701 --> 00:33:11,400
<i>And we've got no shot</i>

416
00:33:11,501 --> 00:33:14,800
<i>This could never be</i>

417
00:33:14,801 --> 00:33:17,700
<i>- You're not the type for me
- Really?</i>

418
00:33:17,801 --> 00:33:22,100
<i>And there's not a spark
in sight</i>

419
00:33:22,201 --> 00:33:27,800
<i>What a waste
of a lovely night</i>

420
00:33:29,001 --> 00:33:30,700
<i>You say
there's nothing here?</i>

421
00:33:30,701 --> 00:33:32,500
<i>Well, let's make something clear</i>

422
00:33:32,501 --> 00:33:35,100
<i>I think I'll be the one
to make that call</i>

423
00:33:35,101 --> 00:33:36,100
But you'll call?

424
00:33:36,101 --> 00:33:38,800
<i>And though you looked so cute
in your polyester suit,</i>

425
00:33:38,801 --> 00:33:39,800
It's wool.

426
00:33:39,801 --> 00:33:42,500
<i>You're right,
I'd never fall for you at all</i>

427
00:33:42,501 --> 00:33:45,800
<i>And maybe this appeals</i>

428
00:33:45,901 --> 00:33:48,700
<i>To someone not in heels</i>

429
00:33:48,801 --> 00:33:52,800
<i>Or to any girl who feels</i>

430
00:33:52,801 --> 00:33:56,300
<i>There's some chance
for romance</i>

431
00:33:56,401 --> 00:33:59,000
<i>But, I'm frankly
feeling nothing</i>

432
00:33:59,001 --> 00:34:00,200
<i>Is that so?</i>

433
00:34:00,201 --> 00:34:02,100
<i>Or it could be
less than nothing</i>

434
00:34:02,201 --> 00:34:05,000
<i>Good to know,
so you agree?</i>

435
00:34:05,001 --> 00:34:06,300
<i>That's right</i>

436
00:34:06,301 --> 00:34:10,600
<i>What a waste
of a lovely night</i>

437
00:36:17,600 --> 00:36:19,300
Ah.

438
00:36:19,401 --> 00:36:21,000
Hi, Greg.

439
00:36:21,301 --> 00:36:23,400
Hi... Oh! Sorry, I'm late.

440
00:36:23,401 --> 00:36:26,600
Yeah. I'll be there soon.
Okay, bye.

441
00:36:46,501 --> 00:36:49,100
- It's... It's just right there.
- Just right here.

442
00:36:49,101 --> 00:36:50,600
Hmm.

443
00:36:54,501 --> 00:36:56,500
Do you want a ride
to your car?

444
00:36:57,301 --> 00:36:59,700
No, I'm just... right up here.

445
00:37:02,001 --> 00:37:03,800
Good night.

446
00:37:09,701 --> 00:37:11,100
Good night.

447
00:38:23,501 --> 00:38:26,800
Excuse me.
This is gluten-free, right?

448
00:38:27,201 --> 00:38:28,200
No.

449
00:38:28,301 --> 00:38:29,300
What?!

450
00:38:29,401 --> 00:38:30,400
Mm-mmm.

451
00:38:30,501 --> 00:38:32,800
What? I'd like a refund.

452
00:38:34,101 --> 00:38:37,300
Okay. Let me check on that for you.

453
00:38:38,101 --> 00:38:41,700
Mia? You're closing friday.

454
00:38:41,701 --> 00:38:44,600
I-I c-I can't close on friday.
I have an audition, remember?

455
00:38:44,701 --> 00:38:46,900
Do I look like I care?
Reschedule it.

456
00:38:47,001 --> 00:38:48,600
- Oh, and, uh, we need to have
- I...

457
00:38:48,601 --> 00:38:50,200
a little talk tomorrow, okay?

458
00:38:50,201 --> 00:38:53,900
- Fix your apron, please.
- Uh... Okay.

459
00:38:58,001 --> 00:38:59,700
You again!

460
00:39:01,601 --> 00:39:02,600
What're you doin' here?

461
00:39:02,601 --> 00:39:06,200
Oh, you know, just meetings
and... studio heads and...

462
00:39:06,201 --> 00:39:08,000
How'd you get on the lot?

463
00:39:08,001 --> 00:39:10,700
I basically just hauled ass
past the guard gates, so...

464
00:39:10,801 --> 00:39:13,600
I think I have 20 minutes
until they find me.

465
00:39:13,701 --> 00:39:15,500
You don't have a break...
coming up, do you?

466
00:39:15,501 --> 00:39:17,400
I'm off in 10 minutes. So...

467
00:39:18,701 --> 00:39:20,300
Can I hide in the bathroom?

468
00:39:20,301 --> 00:39:22,000
- Yes.
- Okay. (Thank you.)

469
00:39:23,601 --> 00:39:24,700
Sorry.

470
00:39:24,801 --> 00:39:26,200
Uh...

471
00:39:26,201 --> 00:39:28,600
I actually do have to check.
I'm... sorry.

472
00:39:32,101 --> 00:39:33,900
That's the window
that Humphrey Bogart

473
00:39:34,001 --> 00:39:35,800
and Ingrid Bergman
looked out of in Casablanca.

474
00:39:35,901 --> 00:39:37,100
- Wow!
- Yeah.

475
00:39:37,201 --> 00:39:39,100
I can't believe you work
right across the street from that.

476
00:39:39,201 --> 00:39:41,000
- Yeah.
- That's amazing.

477
00:39:41,101 --> 00:39:44,700
What was your, uh...,
your Bogart's name?

478
00:39:45,001 --> 00:39:47,200
What's his name?
Is it Greg?

479
00:39:47,201 --> 00:39:49,300
Yeah. Greg.

480
00:39:49,301 --> 00:39:52,000
Right. How long
have you, uh, been...?

481
00:39:52,101 --> 00:39:54,100
We've been seeing each other
for about a month.

482
00:39:54,101 --> 00:39:55,400
Uh, that's great.

483
00:39:55,501 --> 00:39:57,100
He's, uh... He's sweet.

484
00:39:57,101 --> 00:39:59,200
Anyway, I love being around
this stuff, you know?

485
00:39:59,301 --> 00:40:01,700
I know what you mean. I-I get coffee
5 miles out of the way

486
00:40:01,801 --> 00:40:04,400
- just so I can be near a jazz club.
- Really?

487
00:40:04,501 --> 00:40:05,800
Yeah, the Van Beek.
Do you know it?

488
00:40:05,801 --> 00:40:06,800
Mm-mmm.

489
00:40:06,801 --> 00:40:08,200
All the big swing bands
used to play there.

490
00:40:08,201 --> 00:40:10,300
Count Basie, Chick Webb.

491
00:40:11,001 --> 00:40:14,200
Anyway, it's a samba-tapas place
now, so...

492
00:40:14,901 --> 00:40:16,100
What's a samba-tapas place?

493
00:40:16,101 --> 00:40:18,400
You know, it's like a samba place
where they serve tapas.

494
00:40:18,501 --> 00:40:19,500
- Oh.
- Yeah.

495
00:40:19,501 --> 00:40:22,000
So the joke's on... history?

496
00:40:22,001 --> 00:40:23,800
I don't know. That's L.A.
They just...

497
00:40:23,901 --> 00:40:27,300
They-They-They worship everything
and they value nothing.

498
00:40:27,401 --> 00:40:30,100
We're about to roll.
Stop, please, guys.

499
00:40:31,001 --> 00:40:32,300
- You're rolling?
- Yeah.

500
00:40:32,401 --> 00:40:33,400
- Yeah.
- I know.

501
00:40:33,501 --> 00:40:35,300
They shoot movies on my street
all the time, so I know about movies.

502
00:40:35,401 --> 00:40:36,400
- Come this way.
- Right.

503
00:40:36,401 --> 00:40:37,900
It's a lock-down.

504
00:40:38,701 --> 00:40:40,000
- I love her!
- And here we go.

505
00:40:40,101 --> 00:40:42,500
So... Hey, Mia.
How did you get into this?

506
00:40:42,601 --> 00:40:44,400
- And... roll!
- Get into what?

507
00:40:44,401 --> 00:40:45,700
Sound speed!

508
00:40:45,701 --> 00:40:48,100
- You know, movies and acting.
- Action.

509
00:40:48,101 --> 00:40:49,700
Oh.

510
00:40:49,701 --> 00:40:52,100
- My aunt was an actress.
- Oh, okay.

511
00:40:52,401 --> 00:40:54,700
She was in a traveling
theater company.

512
00:40:54,801 --> 00:40:57,100
I grew up in Boulder City,
Nevada.

513
00:40:57,201 --> 00:40:59,800
So across the street from my house
there was this little library,

514
00:40:59,801 --> 00:41:01,300
that had an old movies section.

515
00:41:01,301 --> 00:41:04,600
And so she... she took me
and we spent an entire day

516
00:41:04,601 --> 00:41:06,100
watching all these old movies

517
00:41:06,101 --> 00:41:10,800
like "Notorious" and... "Bringing Up
Baby", "Casablanca"... and...

518
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,800
- Cut it there. Cut!
- Check the gate.

519
00:41:12,901 --> 00:41:14,700
- We can talk now.
- She sounds incredible.

520
00:41:14,701 --> 00:41:15,700
She was incredible.

521
00:41:15,701 --> 00:41:18,200
And I would put on all these plays
in my bedroom...

522
00:41:18,301 --> 00:41:20,900
and... it would basically just be
she and I...

523
00:41:21,001 --> 00:41:23,700
re-enacting those scenes
from the movies.

524
00:41:23,801 --> 00:41:25,400
And then I would write
my own plays.

525
00:41:25,501 --> 00:41:27,200
- Wow.
- Uh... Yeah.

526
00:41:47,901 --> 00:41:49,800
I love it.

527
00:41:53,501 --> 00:41:56,500
So anyway, I left college
after two years to come here.

528
00:41:56,601 --> 00:41:59,400
And, uh, my last audition
was for a teen soap

529
00:41:59,501 --> 00:42:01,900
pitched as Dangerous Minds
meets The O.C.

530
00:42:01,901 --> 00:42:03,800
So, yeah...,

531
00:42:04,101 --> 00:42:06,100
should've been a lawyer.

532
00:42:06,101 --> 00:42:08,800
'Cause the world needs
more lawyers...

533
00:42:08,801 --> 00:42:10,400
It doesn't need more actresses.

534
00:42:10,501 --> 00:42:12,000
You're not just an actress.

535
00:42:12,001 --> 00:42:13,200
What do you mean
"just an actress"?

536
00:42:13,301 --> 00:42:14,700
You said it yourself,
you were a...

537
00:42:14,801 --> 00:42:16,800
y-you were a child prodigy
playwright.

538
00:42:16,801 --> 00:42:18,400
That is not what I said.

539
00:42:18,401 --> 00:42:21,800
Well, you're too modest
to say it, but it's true.

540
00:42:21,901 --> 00:42:23,800
So you could just write
your own roles, you know?

541
00:42:23,901 --> 00:42:25,800
Write something that's
as interesting as you are,

542
00:42:25,901 --> 00:42:27,300
and you don't have to audition
for this...

543
00:42:27,401 --> 00:42:28,800
- Y-Yeah.
- uh, pishi kaka.

544
00:42:28,901 --> 00:42:30,200
Look at Louis Armstrong,
you know?

545
00:42:30,301 --> 00:42:32,100
He could have just played
the marching band charts

546
00:42:32,101 --> 00:42:33,000
that he was given.

547
00:42:33,001 --> 00:42:34,900
But he didn't do it.
What did he do?

548
00:42:35,001 --> 00:42:37,900
- What did he do?
- Well, he made history, didn't he?

549
00:42:38,201 --> 00:42:39,700
Well, I'm gonna stop
auditioning

550
00:42:39,801 --> 00:42:42,200
and I'm gonna make history
instead.

551
00:42:42,201 --> 00:42:45,000
Well, my work is done here.

552
00:42:46,001 --> 00:42:48,000
I should probably tell you
something now.

553
00:42:48,101 --> 00:42:49,700
- Just to get it out the way.
- Mm-hmm.

554
00:42:49,701 --> 00:42:51,800
I hate jazz.

555
00:42:53,301 --> 00:42:54,300
You okay?

556
00:42:54,301 --> 00:42:56,600
What do you mean
you hate jazz?

557
00:42:56,701 --> 00:42:58,500
It just means that when
I listen to it, I don't like it.

558
00:42:58,601 --> 00:43:01,700
Yeah, but it's just a blanket statement
that you don't like jazz.

559
00:43:01,701 --> 00:43:03,800
What are you doing right now?

560
00:43:04,501 --> 00:43:06,100
Nothing.

561
00:43:22,601 --> 00:43:26,000
You know, I just think that people,
when they say that they...,

562
00:43:26,301 --> 00:43:28,500
you know, "I hate jazz"...,

563
00:43:29,201 --> 00:43:31,700
they just...
they don't... have context.

564
00:43:31,801 --> 00:43:33,900
They don't know
where it comes from, you know?

565
00:43:34,001 --> 00:43:37,600
Jazz was born in a little...
flophouse in New Orleans,

566
00:43:37,701 --> 00:43:39,900
and then just because people
were crammed in there,

567
00:43:40,001 --> 00:43:41,200
they spoke
five different languages,

568
00:43:41,301 --> 00:43:42,400
they couldn't
talk to each other.

569
00:43:42,501 --> 00:43:46,100
The only way that they could
communicate... was with jazz.

570
00:43:46,101 --> 00:43:48,700
Yeah, well, what about Kenny G?

571
00:43:49,101 --> 00:43:50,800
- What?
- What about Kenny G?

572
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:53,300
I mean, what about elevator music?
You know?

573
00:43:53,401 --> 00:43:56,200
- Jazz music that I know.
- What about it?

574
00:43:56,301 --> 00:43:57,400
- From my life.
- Mm-hmm.

575
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:59,800
I just...
I mean, I-I find it relaxing.

576
00:43:59,901 --> 00:44:02,300
It's not relaxing.
It's not! It's not.

577
00:44:02,301 --> 00:44:03,800
Sidney Bechet shot somebody

578
00:44:03,801 --> 00:44:05,400
because they told him
he played a wrong note.

579
00:44:05,401 --> 00:44:06,800
That's hardly relaxing.

580
00:44:06,901 --> 00:44:08,000
Yeah, but where I grew up

581
00:44:08,001 --> 00:44:10,900
there was this station
called KJAZZ 103.

582
00:44:11,001 --> 00:44:12,900
And people
would just put on that station

583
00:44:13,001 --> 00:44:14,400
when they had
a cocktail party...

584
00:44:14,401 --> 00:44:15,400
Right.

585
00:44:15,401 --> 00:44:17,700
And everyone would kind of just talk
over it.

586
00:44:17,801 --> 00:44:19,100
- I know.
- 'Cause it was...

587
00:44:19,201 --> 00:44:20,700
- That's the pro... Okay. O-kay.
- It's...

588
00:44:20,801 --> 00:44:22,300
So I think that
that's part of the problem,

589
00:44:22,401 --> 00:44:23,400
is that you can't hear it,
you know?

590
00:44:23,501 --> 00:44:25,800
You have to see it, you have
to see... what's at stake.

591
00:44:25,801 --> 00:44:26,900
I mean, look at these fellas.

592
00:44:26,901 --> 00:44:29,100
Look at... Look at the...
the-the sax player right now.

593
00:44:29,201 --> 00:44:31,300
He just hijacked the song.
He's on his own trail.

594
00:44:31,401 --> 00:44:33,800
Everyone of these guys
are composing, rearranging,

595
00:44:33,901 --> 00:44:35,800
they're writing...
and they're playing the melody.

596
00:44:35,901 --> 00:44:38,100
They're just...
And now look, the trumpet player.

597
00:44:38,201 --> 00:44:40,000
He's got his own idea.
And so...

598
00:44:40,101 --> 00:44:43,900
it's conflict, and it's compromise,
and it's just...

599
00:44:44,001 --> 00:44:47,000
It's new every time.
It's brand new every night.

600
00:44:47,001 --> 00:44:50,000
It's very, very exciting.

601
00:44:56,201 --> 00:44:58,000
And it's dying.

602
00:44:58,001 --> 00:45:01,000
It's dying, Mia,
it's dying on the vine.

603
00:45:01,101 --> 00:45:04,600
And the world says:
"Let it die. It had its time."

604
00:45:04,601 --> 00:45:07,000
Well, not on my watch.

605
00:45:07,801 --> 00:45:09,000
What are you gonna do?

606
00:45:09,201 --> 00:45:11,400
I'll have my own club.

607
00:45:11,401 --> 00:45:12,900
- Really?
- Yes.

608
00:45:13,001 --> 00:45:14,700
We're gonna play
whatever we want,

609
00:45:14,801 --> 00:45:17,000
whenever we want,
however we want,

610
00:45:17,001 --> 00:45:20,900
as long as it's pure jazz.

611
00:45:21,201 --> 00:45:23,200
Hi, this is Mia Dolan.

612
00:45:23,301 --> 00:45:25,900
Yeah, I just missed a call.

613
00:45:32,201 --> 00:45:34,500
- I got a callback.
- What?!

614
00:45:34,501 --> 00:45:36,600
Come on! For what?!

615
00:45:36,601 --> 00:45:40,000
For a TV show! The one
I was telling you about. Really.

616
00:45:40,101 --> 00:45:41,500
The Dangerous Minds
meets The O.C.?

617
00:45:41,501 --> 00:45:42,500
Yeah.

618
00:45:42,501 --> 00:45:44,200
- Congratulations! That's incredible.
- It's really exciting.

619
00:45:44,301 --> 00:45:46,300
I feel like I said negative stuff
about it before.

620
00:45:46,301 --> 00:45:47,300
What?

621
00:45:47,301 --> 00:45:49,400
It's like "Rebel Without a Cause"
sort of.

622
00:45:49,401 --> 00:45:51,700
"I got the bullets!"

623
00:45:51,801 --> 00:45:53,600
Yes.

624
00:45:54,301 --> 00:45:56,100
- You've never seen it!
- I've never seen it.

625
00:45:56,201 --> 00:45:58,800
Oh my. You know,
it's playing in the Rialto.

626
00:45:58,901 --> 00:46:00,100
- Really?
- Yes.

627
00:46:00,201 --> 00:46:04,000
You should go... I mean, I...
I'll go-I'll go-I can take you.

628
00:46:04,101 --> 00:46:05,500
- Okay.
- You know, for research.

629
00:46:05,601 --> 00:46:06,600
- For research.
- Yeah.

630
00:46:06,701 --> 00:46:07,900
- Yeah.
- Okay.

631
00:46:08,001 --> 00:46:10,400
Uh, monday night,
ten-ten o'clock.

632
00:46:10,501 --> 00:46:12,300
- Yeah! Great!
- Okay!

633
00:46:12,301 --> 00:46:13,800
For research.

634
00:46:56,301 --> 00:46:59,200
<i>City of stars,</i>

635
00:46:59,201 --> 00:47:04,800
<i>Are you shining
just for me?</i>

636
00:47:06,201 --> 00:47:09,200
<i>City of stars,</i>

637
00:47:09,201 --> 00:47:14,700
<i>There's so much
that I can't see</i>

638
00:47:15,301 --> 00:47:18,600
<i>Who knows?</i>

639
00:47:18,601 --> 00:47:25,000
<i>Is this the start
of something wonderful and new?</i>

640
00:47:25,301 --> 00:47:35,000
<i>Or one more dream
that I cannot make true?</i>

641
00:48:01,101 --> 00:48:03,800
- Stand right there, please.
- Okay. Nice to meet you.

642
00:48:05,901 --> 00:48:09,000
- (Hi.)
- Hi.

643
00:48:31,601 --> 00:48:34,500
- In your own time.
- Okay.

644
00:48:38,101 --> 00:48:39,500
Two options:

645
00:48:39,501 --> 00:48:42,400
you either follow my rules
or follow my rules. Capisce?

646
00:48:42,401 --> 00:48:43,900
Thank you.

647
00:48:43,901 --> 00:48:46,000
- It's... Oh.
- Thanks.

648
00:48:46,001 --> 00:48:47,100
I can do it a different way.

649
00:48:47,101 --> 00:48:50,100
No, that's-that's fine.
Thank you very much. Thank you.

650
00:48:57,901 --> 00:49:00,300
- That was fun. Thanks.
- Bye.

651
00:49:11,501 --> 00:49:13,500
RIALTO / REBEL WITHOUT A CASE

652
00:49:30,001 --> 00:49:31,400
Hey, Mia.

653
00:49:31,701 --> 00:49:33,700
- What?
- Greg's here.

654
00:49:33,701 --> 00:49:34,800
What do you m...?

655
00:49:34,801 --> 00:49:37,800
Hey, babe.
Got a space out front.

656
00:49:38,201 --> 00:49:39,500
- Great!
- We should get going.

657
00:49:39,601 --> 00:49:42,000
- Ok...
- My brother landed really early.

658
00:49:44,201 --> 00:49:45,200
Did you forget?

659
00:49:45,201 --> 00:49:47,100
- Shit.
- You forgot.

660
00:49:47,101 --> 00:49:48,500
That's tonight...

661
00:49:48,501 --> 00:49:49,700
- That's okay.
- Yeah.

662
00:49:49,801 --> 00:49:51,100
- Yeah. You forgot.
- Okay. All right.

663
00:49:51,101 --> 00:49:52,700
So then I'll just get changed.

664
00:49:52,701 --> 00:49:53,700
- Okay.
- Okay.

665
00:49:53,801 --> 00:49:55,100
- Great.
- Great.

666
00:49:57,601 --> 00:49:58,900
- Yeah, that's him.
- Uh...

667
00:49:58,901 --> 00:50:00,700
Hey, Josh. Yeah. Uh...

668
00:50:00,701 --> 00:50:04,300
Uh, just picking up Mia.
We'll be there in like, uh...

669
00:50:04,901 --> 00:50:06,800
But now we got
this surround-sound set-up.

670
00:50:06,901 --> 00:50:09,100
Oh, it's like being
in a movie theater.

671
00:50:09,101 --> 00:50:10,100
Wow.

672
00:50:10,101 --> 00:50:12,100
Well, better than being
in a theater, really.

673
00:50:12,201 --> 00:50:13,300
And you know theaters
these days.

674
00:50:13,401 --> 00:50:15,100
- Yeah.
- They're so dirty.

675
00:50:15,201 --> 00:50:16,500
Yeah, I know.
And so smelly.

676
00:50:16,601 --> 00:50:18,300
And they're either too hot
or too cold.

677
00:50:18,401 --> 00:50:19,900
I know, the quality's
really fallen off.

678
00:50:20,001 --> 00:50:23,100
Oh, it's terrible! And there's always
people talking. [...]

679
00:50:25,501 --> 00:50:27,700
- [...] texting.
- One second.

680
00:50:28,101 --> 00:50:29,100
Hello?

681
00:50:29,201 --> 00:50:31,500
Probably work.

682
00:50:37,401 --> 00:50:38,600
So, yeah, we love it.

683
00:50:38,601 --> 00:50:41,000
- It's so nice.
- Well, you have to come.

684
00:50:41,001 --> 00:50:43,400
You should. Come by.

685
00:51:00,701 --> 00:51:02,300
I got one more
for you, man:

686
00:51:02,401 --> 00:51:04,100
- Mm-hmm.
- Indonesia.

687
00:51:04,201 --> 00:51:05,800
- I never heard of.
- Anyone say that.

688
00:51:05,901 --> 00:51:07,300
I don't remember
all the track of it,

689
00:51:07,401 --> 00:51:09,000
but honestly,
it was just life changing.

690
00:51:09,101 --> 00:51:10,400
- Really?
- Yeah.

691
00:51:10,401 --> 00:51:12,000
It did-did affected me. [...]

692
00:51:12,501 --> 00:51:13,600
Is it amazing?

693
00:51:13,701 --> 00:51:14,800
Yes.

694
00:51:14,801 --> 00:51:16,100
A five-star
jungle-eco resort.

695
00:51:16,201 --> 00:51:17,600
- Wow.
- You would not believe.

696
00:51:17,601 --> 00:51:18,600
Amazing.

697
00:51:18,601 --> 00:51:19,600
We were thinking
about Nicaragua.

698
00:51:19,701 --> 00:51:21,400
The thing 'bout Nicaragua
is it's less developed.

699
00:51:21,501 --> 00:51:22,600
- It's a bit underdeveloped.
- Right.

700
00:51:22,701 --> 00:51:24,500
You know? I think
there's a little more offert.

701
00:51:24,601 --> 00:51:27,200
Yeah, I just... I don't know,
I don't know if it's safe there.

702
00:51:27,201 --> 00:51:28,500
Yeah, yeah. [...]

703
00:52:00,401 --> 00:52:02,300
I'm sorry.

704
00:53:36,201 --> 00:53:38,600
[...] An immensity of our universe.

705
00:53:38,601 --> 00:53:41,400
For many days,
before the end of our Earth,

706
00:53:41,501 --> 00:53:44,900
people will look into the night sky
and notice a star,

707
00:53:45,001 --> 00:53:48,100
increasingly bright
and increasingly near.

708
00:53:48,201 --> 00:53:50,800
As this star
approaches us...

709
00:53:51,801 --> 00:53:53,900
Jim Stark.

710
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:56,100
I'll go find a place.
I'm sorry.

711
00:53:56,201 --> 00:53:58,500
As this star
approaches us,

712
00:53:58,501 --> 00:53:59,700
the weather will change.

713
00:53:59,701 --> 00:54:02,200
The great polar fields
of the north and south

714
00:54:02,301 --> 00:54:06,900
will rot and divide.
And the seas will turn warmer.

715
00:54:07,201 --> 00:54:10,300
The last of us search the heavens
and stand amazed.

716
00:54:10,401 --> 00:54:12,800
For the stars
will still be there...

717
00:54:12,801 --> 00:54:14,700
moving through their [...]

718
00:54:30,801 --> 00:54:32,900
I have an idea.

719
00:55:08,701 --> 00:55:10,700
TESLA COIL

720
00:58:53,101 --> 00:58:56,100
GENEVIEVE: Holy hell!

721
00:59:07,601 --> 00:59:09,500
What is that?
Is that a script?

722
00:59:09,601 --> 00:59:12,100
- It's a play.
- A play?!

723
00:59:12,101 --> 00:59:13,900
You better give us all roles!

724
00:59:13,901 --> 00:59:16,400
Actually,
it's a one-woman show!

725
00:59:16,401 --> 00:59:18,300
So I can't.

726
00:59:22,601 --> 00:59:25,700
Wow!
Is that gonna happen everytime?

727
00:59:25,701 --> 00:59:27,100
I think so.

728
00:59:42,201 --> 00:59:44,400
Wait! It's one way.

729
00:59:49,901 --> 00:59:51,500
SUMMER

730
01:02:05,101 --> 01:02:07,400
- I love you.
- Love you too.

731
01:02:21,501 --> 01:02:23,300
Sebastian?

732
01:02:26,601 --> 01:02:28,000
Keith.

733
01:02:28,101 --> 01:02:29,900
Come here, man!

734
01:02:31,001 --> 01:02:32,800
- How are you?
- Very good, man.

735
01:02:32,801 --> 01:02:35,000
This is Mia. Mia, Keith.

736
01:02:35,001 --> 01:02:36,900
- Hi, Mia, nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

737
01:02:36,901 --> 01:02:38,600
I used to play with this guy.

738
01:02:38,701 --> 01:02:40,300
We went to school together.

739
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:42,100
- So, how you been, brother?
- Great.

740
01:02:42,201 --> 01:02:43,500
Never been better.
How 'bout you?

741
01:02:43,601 --> 01:02:45,400
I've been really good,
been very busy.

742
01:02:45,501 --> 01:02:47,500
- I got a new combo.
- Okay.

743
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:50,300
- Cool.
- We're looking for keys.

744
01:02:50,901 --> 01:02:53,300
- You kidding me?
- No, I'm not kidding.

745
01:02:53,401 --> 01:02:56,400
- No, I'm good.
- You sure? It pays.

746
01:02:56,701 --> 01:02:58,200
I'm good.

747
01:02:58,201 --> 01:03:00,500
Let's just grab a drink then.
It's been too long.

748
01:03:00,601 --> 01:03:03,800
- Okay. Nice to meet you, Mia.
- Nice to meet you.

749
01:03:13,001 --> 01:03:15,000
The end.

750
01:03:16,501 --> 01:03:18,100
It's...

751
01:03:19,501 --> 01:03:21,200
Genius.

752
01:03:21,201 --> 01:03:22,200
- Really?
- Yes.

753
01:03:22,301 --> 01:03:23,300
- Really?
- Yes.

754
01:03:23,401 --> 01:03:24,800
It feels really nostalgic
to me.

755
01:03:24,901 --> 01:03:25,900
- That's the point.
- Is it too nostalgic?

756
01:03:26,001 --> 01:03:28,300
- That's...
- Are people gonna like it?

757
01:03:28,601 --> 01:03:30,100
Fuck 'em.

758
01:03:30,401 --> 01:03:33,700
- You always say that.
- Well, I truly believe that.

759
01:03:33,801 --> 01:03:36,200
- I made you something.
- For what?

760
01:03:36,201 --> 01:03:38,400
For your club.

761
01:03:40,101 --> 01:03:41,400
Why does it say "Seb's"?

762
01:03:41,401 --> 01:03:42,700
'Cause I think you should
call it "Seb's".

763
01:03:42,701 --> 01:03:43,700
What?

764
01:03:43,701 --> 01:03:45,300
'Cause no one's gonna come
to "Chicken on a Stick".

765
01:03:45,401 --> 01:03:47,100
Is that a music note
as an apostrophe?

766
01:03:47,201 --> 01:03:48,300
- Yes.
- That's pretty cool.

767
01:03:48,401 --> 01:03:49,800
- Yeah.
- It's gotta be "Chicken on a Stick".

768
01:03:49,801 --> 01:03:50,800
Hmm...

769
01:03:50,801 --> 01:03:52,900
Because... Charlie Parker
got his nickname...

770
01:03:53,001 --> 01:03:55,400
...nickname
because he loved chicken.

771
01:03:56,201 --> 01:03:58,400
That's why they called him "Bird".

772
01:03:58,401 --> 01:04:01,300
So I'm gonna have chicken,
beer, jazz... "Chicken on a Stick!"

773
01:04:01,401 --> 01:04:03,000
I know. I think you should
drop the chicken

774
01:04:03,101 --> 01:04:05,200
and just have drinks and jazz,
and also there could be...

775
01:04:05,201 --> 01:04:06,200
I'm not dropping the chicken.

776
01:04:06,201 --> 01:04:07,700
You could maybe do it
somewhere else?

777
01:04:07,801 --> 01:04:09,400
- What're you talkin'...?
- Find a new spot?

778
01:04:09,501 --> 01:04:12,000
- It's gotta be the Van Beek.
- It doesn't have to be the Van Beek.

779
01:04:12,101 --> 01:04:14,400
I can't let them samba
all over its history.

780
01:04:14,501 --> 01:04:16,400
- Oh...
- I can't do it.

781
01:04:16,501 --> 01:04:19,200
You can let them,
but you refuse to.

782
01:04:19,201 --> 01:04:21,200
Your play's incredible.

783
01:04:21,501 --> 01:04:25,500
You know? The whole world
from your bedroom.

784
01:04:25,801 --> 01:04:27,900
What else do they want?

785
01:04:28,001 --> 01:04:29,800
Who's doing that?

786
01:04:30,101 --> 01:04:32,300
- I'm doing that.
- You're doing that?

787
01:04:33,201 --> 01:04:35,600
Who was that guy
at The Lighthouse?

788
01:04:36,201 --> 01:04:38,000
- The guy that offered you the gig?
- Keith.

789
01:04:38,101 --> 01:04:40,100
Yeah. Why was it so weird
between you two?

790
01:04:40,201 --> 01:04:42,700
It's-It's just always weird...
with him.

791
01:04:42,801 --> 01:04:44,300
- Really?
- Yeah.

792
01:04:44,401 --> 01:04:48,200
But he seemed kinda nice
because he did offer you a job.

793
01:04:48,601 --> 01:04:49,700
Are you gonna call him?

794
01:04:49,801 --> 01:04:51,600
No.

795
01:04:52,101 --> 01:04:54,900
- No.
- All right.

796
01:04:54,901 --> 01:04:56,900
So...

797
01:04:57,201 --> 01:04:59,900
- Here's what we know.
- Yeah?

798
01:05:00,001 --> 01:05:02,800
It's definitely
"Chicken on a Stick"...

799
01:05:03,301 --> 01:05:06,300
and your play's gonna be
a triumph.

800
01:05:08,301 --> 01:05:10,000
It's a one-woman show.

801
01:05:10,001 --> 01:05:12,800
So it's just me. No, I... I mean,
I'm acting in it.

802
01:05:12,801 --> 01:05:14,500
It's gonnna be cool.

803
01:05:15,001 --> 01:05:19,700
No, Mom, I-I'm not getting paid.
I'm... paying to do it.

804
01:05:21,001 --> 01:05:23,600
He's great. He's gonna open
his own jazz club.

805
01:05:23,601 --> 01:05:26,000
Yeah, it's gonna be incredible.

806
01:05:27,701 --> 01:05:31,500
Uh, no. He's... He hasn't opened it
yet. He needs, uh...

807
01:05:35,101 --> 01:05:37,600
He's saving up, I think.

808
01:05:43,001 --> 01:05:44,900
No, but he doesn't have
a steady gig.

809
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:46,700
But he's-he's figuring it out.

810
01:05:46,701 --> 01:05:49,200
It's just been a little
tricky lately.

811
01:05:51,801 --> 01:05:53,700
Mom, he's gonna find a way
to open it

812
01:05:53,801 --> 01:05:55,200
and you're gonna love it,
okay?

813
01:05:55,201 --> 01:05:57,100
How's Dad?

814
01:06:04,201 --> 01:06:06,000
Sebastian!

815
01:06:06,101 --> 01:06:08,400
Come on in, man.

816
01:06:09,001 --> 01:06:10,900
- Thanks for comin'.
- Thanks for having me.

817
01:06:11,001 --> 01:06:13,100
I wasn't sure
I'd see you today.

818
01:06:13,401 --> 01:06:15,300
- So, here's the deal.
- Okay.

819
01:06:15,401 --> 01:06:17,700
- We got distribution with Universal.
- Wow.

820
01:06:17,801 --> 01:06:19,900
We've got our own imprint.
We're about to go on the road.

821
01:06:20,001 --> 01:06:22,000
Uh, we can pay you
a thousand bucks a week...

822
01:06:22,101 --> 01:06:27,000
plus a cut of the ticket revenue
and merchandising. Sound good?

823
01:06:29,301 --> 01:06:30,500
- Sebastian?
- Yup.

824
01:06:30,501 --> 01:06:31,900
All right?

825
01:06:31,901 --> 01:06:33,800
- Let's play.
- Okay.

826
01:07:24,701 --> 01:07:28,600
<i>But I know I'll fell... [so good]
tonight</i>

827
01:07:30,101 --> 01:07:33,600
I know. It's different.

828
01:07:35,101 --> 01:07:37,400
But you say you want
to save jazz.

829
01:07:37,501 --> 01:07:40,100
How are you gonna save jazz
if no one's listening?

830
01:07:40,201 --> 01:07:42,400
Jazz is dying
because of people like you.

831
01:07:42,501 --> 01:07:46,800
You're... playin' into 90-year-olds
at The Lighthouse.

832
01:07:46,901 --> 01:07:49,800
Where are the kids?
Where are the young people?

833
01:07:49,901 --> 01:07:53,800
You're so obsessed
with Kenny Clarke and Thelonious Monk.

834
01:07:53,801 --> 01:07:55,900
These guys were revolutionaries.

835
01:07:55,901 --> 01:07:57,900
How are you going to be
a revolutionary,

836
01:07:57,901 --> 01:07:59,900
if you're such a traditionalist?

837
01:07:59,901 --> 01:08:04,700
You're holding onto the past...,
but jazz is about the future.

838
01:08:08,701 --> 01:08:10,400
I know.

839
01:08:10,401 --> 01:08:14,500
The other guy,
he wasn't as good as you.

840
01:08:14,801 --> 01:08:18,300
But you're a pain in the ass,
man.

841
01:08:57,401 --> 01:09:00,300
<i>City of stars,</i>

842
01:09:00,301 --> 01:09:04,400
<i>Are you shining
just for me?</i>

843
01:09:06,901 --> 01:09:09,900
<i>City of stars,</i>

844
01:09:09,901 --> 01:09:14,100

845
01:09:16,001 --> 01:09:18,800
<i>Who knows?</i>

846
01:09:19,401 --> 01:09:25,700
<i>I felt it from the first embrace
I shared with you</i>

847
01:09:25,801 --> 01:09:33,800
<i>That now our dreams
may fin'lly come true</i>

848
01:09:36,101 --> 01:09:38,900
<i>City of stars,</i>

01:09:38,901 --> 01:09:42,900
<i>Just one thing

850
01:09:45,301 --> 01:09:47,800

01:09:47,801 --> 01:09:53,700
<i>And through the smokescreen

852
01:09:53,701 --> 01:09:56,900
<i>It's love</i>

853
01:09:56,901 --> 01:10:03,000
<i>Yes, all we're looking for
is love from someone else</i>

854
01:10:03,101 --> 01:10:05,300
<i>- A rush
- A glance</i>

855
01:10:05,401 --> 01:10:07,600
<i>- A touch
- A dance</i>

856
01:10:07,601 --> 01:10:10,800
<i>A look in somebody's eyes</i>

857
01:10:10,901 --> 01:10:13,100
<i>To light up the skies,</i>

858
01:10:13,101 --> 01:10:16,200
<i>To open the world
and send it reeling,</i>

859
01:10:16,201 --> 01:10:18,200
<i>A voice that says</i>

860
01:10:18,201 --> 01:10:23,000
<i>"I'll be here
and you'll be alright"</i>

861
01:10:25,101 --> 01:10:30,200
<i>I don't care if I know
just where I will go,</i>

862
01:10:30,301 --> 01:10:33,400
<i>'Cause all that I need's
this crazy feeling</i>

863
01:10:33,401 --> 01:10:37,700
<i>A rat-tat-tat on my heart</i>

864
01:10:37,801 --> 01:10:41,600
<i>Think I want it to stay</i>

Don't you know?</i>

908
01:15:59,301 --> 01:16:00,900
<i>Tonight</i>

01:16:09,501 --> 01:16:11,500
FALL

910
01:16:19,901 --> 01:16:22,900
SO LONG, BOULDER CITY

911
01:16:38,001 --> 01:16:39,800
Hey, it's me.

912
01:16:39,801 --> 01:16:41,700
Uh, I'm not sure
where you are right now.

913
01:16:41,701 --> 01:16:43,000
I think Boston?

914
01:16:43,101 --> 01:16:45,500
Maybe Dallas, I don't know.

915
01:16:45,601 --> 01:16:47,400
Uh...

916
01:16:47,401 --> 01:16:50,700
I haven't heard from you
in a little while...

917
01:16:51,401 --> 01:16:53,600
and I miss you.

918
01:16:55,101 --> 01:16:57,200
All right, bye.

919
01:17:33,001 --> 01:17:34,700
I thought...

920
01:17:35,501 --> 01:17:37,300
Surprise.

921
01:17:39,301 --> 01:17:40,800
I gotta leave
first thing in the morning,

922
01:17:40,801 --> 01:17:43,200
but I just... I had to see you.

923
01:17:47,901 --> 01:17:50,000
It's so nice to be home.

924
01:17:52,501 --> 01:17:54,600
I'm so glad you're home.

925
01:17:56,701 --> 01:17:58,200
How's the play going?

926
01:17:58,301 --> 01:18:00,600
Uh... I'm nervous.

927
01:18:00,601 --> 01:18:01,600
- You are?
- Mm-hmm.

928
01:18:01,601 --> 01:18:02,600
Why?

929
01:18:02,601 --> 01:18:04,600
Because...
what if people show up?

930
01:18:04,601 --> 01:18:06,300
Pishi kaka.

931
01:18:06,301 --> 01:18:08,800
You're nervous
about what they think?

932
01:18:09,101 --> 01:18:11,900
I'm nervous to do it.
I'm nervous to get up...

933
01:18:12,001 --> 01:18:13,400
on a stage
and perform for people.

934
01:18:13,501 --> 01:18:14,800
I mean, I don't need
to say that to you.

935
01:18:14,901 --> 01:18:16,600
- It's gonna be incredible.
- You don't get it,

936
01:18:16,601 --> 01:18:18,500
but I'm terrified.

937
01:18:18,501 --> 01:18:22,500
They should be so lucky to see it.
I can't wait.

938
01:18:22,501 --> 01:18:24,400
I can.

939
01:18:26,301 --> 01:18:28,200
When do you leave?
In the morning?

940
01:18:28,501 --> 01:18:33,000
Yeah. 6:45. Boise.

941
01:18:33,001 --> 01:18:35,100
- Boisi?
- Boise.

942
01:18:35,401 --> 01:18:37,200
To Boise!

943
01:18:39,601 --> 01:18:41,500
You should come.

944
01:18:42,401 --> 01:18:43,600
To Boise?

945
01:18:43,601 --> 01:18:46,400
Yeah, you can knock that off
your bucket list.

946
01:18:46,501 --> 01:18:49,300
Oh, that would be...
really exciting. I wish I could.

947
01:18:49,401 --> 01:18:51,700
What are you doin'
after the tour?

948
01:18:52,201 --> 01:18:53,700
Why can't you?

949
01:18:53,701 --> 01:18:54,900
- Come to Boise?
- Yeah.

950
01:18:54,901 --> 01:18:56,500
'Cause I have to rehearse.

951
01:18:56,501 --> 01:18:59,500
Yeah, but can't you rehearse
anywhere?

952
01:19:02,001 --> 01:19:04,200
Anywhere you are?

953
01:19:04,301 --> 01:19:07,200
I mean... I guess.

954
01:19:07,301 --> 01:19:08,600
Uh...

955
01:19:08,601 --> 01:19:11,000
Well, all my stuff is here
and it's in two weeks.

956
01:19:11,101 --> 01:19:13,600
So I don't really think
that would be...

957
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:14,900
Okay.

958
01:19:14,901 --> 01:19:16,800
- the best idea right now,
- Well...

959
01:19:16,801 --> 01:19:20,200
but... I wish I could.

960
01:19:20,501 --> 01:19:22,400
We're just gonna have to try
and see each other, you know,

961
01:19:22,501 --> 01:19:25,900
- so that we see each other.
- I know, but when are you done?

962
01:19:26,401 --> 01:19:28,300
What do you mean?
I mean...

963
01:19:29,101 --> 01:19:31,000
When you're finished
with the whole tour?

964
01:19:31,101 --> 01:19:33,300
But after we finish,
we're gonna go to record

965
01:19:33,401 --> 01:19:35,200
and then we'll go back
on tour.

966
01:19:35,301 --> 01:19:37,000
You know, we tour
so we can make the record

967
01:19:37,101 --> 01:19:39,800
so we can go back and tour
the record.

968
01:19:43,001 --> 01:19:45,500
So it's like the long haul?

969
01:19:48,401 --> 01:19:50,100
What do you mean
"the long haul"?

970
01:19:50,201 --> 01:19:53,200
I mean the long haul
like you're gonna stay in this band...

971
01:19:53,201 --> 01:19:55,400
for a long time.

972
01:19:55,901 --> 01:19:58,000
On tour.

973
01:19:59,201 --> 01:20:01,100
I mean, what did you think
I was going to do?

974
01:20:01,101 --> 01:20:02,400
I don't... I...

975
01:20:02,401 --> 01:20:06,000
I hadn't really thought it through.
I didn't know that the band...

976
01:20:07,001 --> 01:20:08,100
was so important.

977
01:20:08,101 --> 01:20:10,000
You didn't think
it would be successful?

978
01:20:10,001 --> 01:20:12,200
Uh...

979
01:20:12,901 --> 01:20:14,300
No, that's not really
what I mean.

980
01:20:14,301 --> 01:20:15,500
I just mean that you-you...

981
01:20:15,501 --> 01:20:17,700
I mean... you're gonna be
on tour for what?

982
01:20:17,701 --> 01:20:19,300
Months now? Years?

983
01:20:19,301 --> 01:20:20,900
Yeah, I don't belie...
This is it.

984
01:20:21,001 --> 01:20:23,200
I mean, this is-it could easibly
be, yeah, for...

985
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:24,900
I could be on tour
with this...

986
01:20:25,001 --> 01:20:28,100
for a couple of years,
at least just this record.

987
01:20:28,601 --> 01:20:31,600
Do you like the music
you're playing?

988
01:20:33,101 --> 01:20:34,900
I don't...

989
01:20:34,901 --> 01:20:38,700
I don't know...
what-what it matters.

990
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:40,200
Well, it matters

991
01:20:40,201 --> 01:20:42,000
because if you're going
to give up your dream,

992
01:20:42,001 --> 01:20:43,200
I think it matters

993
01:20:43,201 --> 01:20:45,100
that you like
what you're playing

994
01:20:45,101 --> 01:20:47,800
on the road for years.

995
01:20:49,401 --> 01:20:51,100
Do you like the music
I'm playing?

996
01:20:51,101 --> 01:20:52,800
Yeah.

997
01:20:54,101 --> 01:20:55,200
I do.

998
01:20:55,201 --> 01:20:57,100
I just didn't think
that you did.

999
01:20:57,101 --> 01:20:58,200
Yeah, well...

1000
01:20:58,301 --> 01:21:00,000
You always said Keith is the worst

1001
01:21:00,001 --> 01:21:02,100
and now you're gonna be
on tour with him for years,

1002
01:21:02,201 --> 01:21:03,300
- so I just didn't...
- I don't know what-

1003
01:21:03,401 --> 01:21:04,500
- what are you doing right now?
- know if you were happy.

1004
01:21:04,601 --> 01:21:06,300
- Why are you doing this?
- I don't...

1005
01:21:06,401 --> 01:21:07,500
What do you mean
why am I doing this...?

1006
01:21:07,601 --> 01:21:09,300
I thought you wanted me to do this
and it just sounds like

1007
01:21:09,401 --> 01:21:10,700
- now you don't want me to do it.
- What do you mean

1008
01:21:10,701 --> 01:21:12,300
I wanted you to do this?

1009
01:21:12,401 --> 01:21:14,600
This is what you wanted for me.

1010
01:21:14,701 --> 01:21:15,900
To be in this band?

1011
01:21:15,901 --> 01:21:18,400
To be in a band to have
a steady job, you know?

1012
01:21:18,401 --> 01:21:21,800
To-To-To be... You know.

1013
01:21:22,101 --> 01:21:24,100
Of course I wanted you
to have a steady job,

1014
01:21:24,201 --> 01:21:26,300
so that you could take care of yourself
and your life

1015
01:21:26,401 --> 01:21:28,000
- and you could start your club.
- Yes, so I'm doing that,

1016
01:21:28,101 --> 01:21:30,000
so I don't understand,
well, why aren't we celebrating?

1017
01:21:30,001 --> 01:21:31,900
Why aren't you starting your club?

1018
01:21:31,901 --> 01:21:34,400
You said yourself no one
wants to go to that club.

1019
01:21:34,501 --> 01:21:36,600
No one wants to go to a club
called "Chicken on a Stick".

1020
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:37,900
So change the name!

1021
01:21:37,901 --> 01:21:40,100
Well, no one likes jazz!
Not even you!

1022
01:21:40,201 --> 01:21:41,600
I do like jazz now
because of you!

1023
01:21:41,701 --> 01:21:44,300
And this is what I thought
you wanted me to do!

1024
01:21:44,401 --> 01:21:47,600
What am I supposed to do?
Go back to... playing Jingle Bells?

1025
01:21:47,701 --> 01:21:49,100
I'm not saying that.
I'm saying, why don't you...

1026
01:21:49,201 --> 01:21:52,100
Scraping pennies? So I can start
a club that no one wants to go?

1027
01:21:52,201 --> 01:21:53,600
...take what you've made
and start the club?!

1028
01:21:53,701 --> 01:21:55,600
Then people will wanna go to it
because you're passionate about it,

1029
01:21:55,701 --> 01:21:58,000
and people love what other people
are passionate about.

1030
01:21:58,101 --> 01:21:59,500
You remind people
of what they forgot.

1031
01:21:59,501 --> 01:22:01,800
Not in my experience.

1032
01:22:04,201 --> 01:22:05,400
Well, whatever, alright?

1033
01:22:05,401 --> 01:22:07,700
I mean, it is-it's just-
it's time to grow up, you know?

1034
01:22:07,801 --> 01:22:10,000
I have a steady job,
this is what I'm doing...

1035
01:22:10,101 --> 01:22:11,800
And now all of a sudden
if you had these problems,

1036
01:22:11,901 --> 01:22:13,200
I wish you would've said them
earlier

1037
01:22:13,301 --> 01:22:15,200
before I signed
on the goddamn dotted line!

1038
01:22:15,301 --> 01:22:16,900
I'm pointing out
that you had a dream

1039
01:22:17,001 --> 01:22:18,500
that you followed,
that you were sticking to...

1040
01:22:18,601 --> 01:22:20,900
This is the dream!
This is the dream.

1041
01:22:21,001 --> 01:22:22,500
- This is not your dream!
- Guys like me

1042
01:22:22,601 --> 01:22:25,500
work their whole lives to be
in something that's successful,

1043
01:22:25,601 --> 01:22:28,700
that people like, you know?
I mean, I'm finally

1044
01:22:28,801 --> 01:22:31,500
in something that-that-that-
that-that-that people enjoy.

1045
01:22:31,601 --> 01:22:33,500
Since when do you care
about being liked?

1046
01:22:33,601 --> 01:22:35,300
Just 'cause I don't enjoy it,
it doesn't matter.

1047
01:22:35,401 --> 01:22:37,000
Why do you care so much
about being liked?

1048
01:22:37,101 --> 01:22:39,900
You are an actress!
What are you talking about?!

1049
01:22:56,901 --> 01:22:58,700
Maybe you just liked me
when I was on my ass

1050
01:22:58,801 --> 01:23:03,400
'cause it made you feel better
about yourself.

1051
01:23:05,501 --> 01:23:08,200
- Are you kidding?
- No.

1052
01:23:29,101 --> 01:23:30,900
I don't know...

1053
01:24:23,901 --> 01:24:26,400
SO LONG, BOULDER CITY / TONIGHT

1054
01:24:50,201 --> 01:24:52,600
Okay, fellas. I'll...
see ya tomorrow.

1055
01:24:52,701 --> 01:24:54,000
- Sebastian?
- Yeah?

1056
01:24:54,101 --> 01:24:56,000
You're good for tonight,
right?

1057
01:24:57,201 --> 01:25:00,400
- What are you talking about?
- At 7, the photo shoot.

1058
01:25:01,201 --> 01:25:03,800
For Mojo. You good?

1059
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:10,000
- I thought that was next thursday.
- No, it's tonight.

1060
01:25:12,101 --> 01:25:14,000
Is that okay?

1061
01:26:09,601 --> 01:26:11,800
- Tonya, gimme the other camera!
- What's wrong with that one?

1062
01:26:11,901 --> 01:26:12,900
"What's wrong with that one"?
I don't know.

1063
01:26:13,001 --> 01:26:15,200
It does not bloody work!
That's what's wrong with it!

1064
01:26:15,301 --> 01:26:17,800
Alright, trumpet,
that's lovely!

1065
01:26:18,501 --> 01:26:21,500
Lovely! Beautiful, beautiful!

1066
01:26:21,601 --> 01:26:24,000
Okay, keyboard.
Okay, look up.

1067
01:26:24,101 --> 01:26:26,500
That's good!
That's good, that's lovely!

1068
01:26:26,501 --> 01:26:28,600
Lovely. Okay, cut the music!

1069
01:26:28,601 --> 01:26:31,000
That is lovely.
That's lovely.

1070
01:26:31,101 --> 01:26:34,700
Okay, now look.
Now... bite your lip like...

1071
01:26:35,001 --> 01:26:36,900
like you're concentrating
on... on something,

1072
01:26:37,001 --> 01:26:39,100
I don't know, like a piece of-
a piece of your music.

1073
01:26:39,201 --> 01:26:41,900
- Bite my what?
- Your lip. You know, bite your lip.

1074
01:26:43,101 --> 01:26:44,300
Okay.

1075
01:26:44,301 --> 01:26:46,900
Yeah, that's good.
That's great. Beautiful!

1076
01:26:46,901 --> 01:26:47,900
Beautiful. Okay.

1077
01:26:47,901 --> 01:26:51,100
Now just-just move your-move
your glasses down on... on the nose.

1078
01:26:51,201 --> 01:26:53,300
A little bit-A little bit bit further.
Just a little bit, a touch further.

1079
01:26:53,401 --> 01:26:55,600
Keep your head down,
but look up at me.

1080
01:26:55,601 --> 01:26:57,400
Look sort of... moody.

1081
01:26:57,401 --> 01:27:00,100
Yeah! That's beautiful.
That is great.

1082
01:27:00,101 --> 01:27:02,600
Okay, turn the keyboard on live!

1083
01:27:03,201 --> 01:27:04,300
You wanna hear
the keyboard playin'?

1084
01:27:04,401 --> 01:27:07,100
Nah. You don't have
to bite your lip now.

1085
01:27:07,401 --> 01:27:09,400
Well, actually play something.

1086
01:27:10,001 --> 01:27:11,800
Play something, you know.
Anything.

1087
01:27:11,901 --> 01:27:14,900
You're pianist, aren't you?
Play something.

1088
01:27:27,101 --> 01:27:30,000
That's great. That's beautiful.
That's lovely.

1089
01:27:30,101 --> 01:27:32,900
Oh, that's good.
Now don't stop, keep playing.

1090
01:27:33,001 --> 01:27:36,400
Go on, just keep playing.
That was great!

1091
01:28:15,401 --> 01:28:17,500
Shoot myself in the head.

1092
01:28:18,901 --> 01:28:22,100
- She's not even good.
- That whole window thing...

1093
01:28:22,201 --> 01:28:23,200
- What was that?
- Yeah.

1094
01:28:23,301 --> 01:28:24,700
What did she do
with the window?!

1095
01:28:24,801 --> 01:28:27,500
Oh my God!
Don't quit your day job.

1096
01:28:27,501 --> 01:28:29,600
Oh well...

1097
01:28:55,601 --> 01:28:57,400
Mia!

1098
01:28:58,801 --> 01:29:02,200
Mia. I'm so sorry.

1099
01:29:03,901 --> 01:29:07,300
Just tell me how it went?
How was it?

1100
01:29:07,301 --> 01:29:08,900
I'm sorry.

1101
01:29:08,901 --> 01:29:10,500
- I'm sorry I've been such a prick.
- You're sorry...

1102
01:29:10,601 --> 01:29:12,600
- I'm sorry I didn't come.
- You're sorry... You sor...

1103
01:29:13,501 --> 01:29:16,200
- You're sorry...
- I'm gonna make it up to you.

1104
01:29:16,601 --> 01:29:19,000
Let me make it up to you,
okay?

1105
01:29:24,601 --> 01:29:27,200
- I don't blame you for not wanting...
- It's over.

1106
01:29:27,901 --> 01:29:30,100
- What is?
- It's over.

1107
01:29:30,101 --> 01:29:31,800
What?

1108
01:29:33,001 --> 01:29:34,700
All of this.

1109
01:29:34,701 --> 01:29:38,900
I'm done embarrassing myself.
I'm done. I'm done.

1110
01:29:39,201 --> 01:29:40,700
- Nobody showed up.
- What're you talkin'? So what?

1111
01:29:40,801 --> 01:29:44,100
I can't pay back the theater!
This is so...

1112
01:29:45,001 --> 01:29:47,200
- I'm gonna go home for a while.
- "I'm gonna..."?

1113
01:29:47,301 --> 01:29:50,400
- I'll come see you tomorrow.
- No, I'm going "home" home.

1114
01:29:50,701 --> 01:29:53,700
- This is home.
- No, it's not anymore.

1115
01:30:51,901 --> 01:30:53,900
Theatre Background

1116
01:30:56,201 --> 01:30:58,700
THEATRE / THEATHER / COMEDY /
DRAMA / PLAY / STAGE / MUSICAL

1117
01:32:08,901 --> 01:32:09,900
Yep?

1118
01:32:09,901 --> 01:32:12,500
Hi, I'm trying to reach
Mia Dolan.

1119
01:32:13,001 --> 01:32:14,200
Wrong number.

1120
01:32:14,201 --> 01:32:16,700
Yeah, she said if she's not on her cell,
I was told I might find her here.

1121
01:32:16,701 --> 01:32:18,200
Not anymore.

1122
01:32:18,201 --> 01:32:20,800
- Okay. Well, if you do talk to her...
- I won't.

1123
01:32:20,901 --> 01:32:24,900
could you tell her Jane from Amy Brandt
casting is trying to reach her?

1124
01:32:29,601 --> 01:32:31,400
Casting?

1125
01:32:39,301 --> 01:32:41,600
What the hell is that?

1126
01:32:46,001 --> 01:32:47,900
Shut that thing off!

1127
01:32:58,301 --> 01:32:59,500
Why did you come here?

1128
01:32:59,601 --> 01:33:01,500
Because I have good news.

1129
01:33:01,601 --> 01:33:02,900
What?

1130
01:33:02,901 --> 01:33:05,500
Amy Brandt,
the casting director.

1131
01:33:05,601 --> 01:33:07,900
- Yeah?
- She was at your play.

1132
01:33:07,901 --> 01:33:09,500
And she loved it.

1133
01:33:09,601 --> 01:33:12,000
And she loved it so much...

1134
01:33:12,001 --> 01:33:14,600
that she wants you to come in
tomorrow and audition for this...

1135
01:33:14,601 --> 01:33:16,900
huge movie that she's got.

1136
01:33:17,901 --> 01:33:19,900
I'm not going to that.

1137
01:33:21,601 --> 01:33:22,800
- I'm not going to that.
- What?

1138
01:33:22,901 --> 01:33:25,600
That one's gonna be...
No. That one's gonna be...

1139
01:33:25,601 --> 01:33:27,000
I'm sorry?

1140
01:33:27,101 --> 01:33:29,200
That will kill me.

1141
01:33:30,301 --> 01:33:33,500
- What?!
- What? What? Shh. Stop!

1142
01:33:33,601 --> 01:33:35,900
- No!
- Shh! Shh. You have to be quiet.

1143
01:33:36,001 --> 01:33:37,800
If you want me to be,
then you have to make sense.

1144
01:33:37,901 --> 01:33:39,100
- They're gonna call...
- If you want me to be quiet,

1145
01:33:39,201 --> 01:33:40,300
you're gonna have to make
some goddamn sense.

1146
01:33:40,401 --> 01:33:41,500
- They're gonna call the police.
- Tell me why you're not goin'.

1147
01:33:41,601 --> 01:33:42,700
- Because? Because...
- Why?

1148
01:33:42,801 --> 01:33:44,900
I've been to a million of auditions,
and the same thing happens every time.

1149
01:33:45,001 --> 01:33:47,700
Or I get interrupted because
someone wants to get a sandwich,

1150
01:33:47,801 --> 01:33:50,400
or I'm crying
and they start laughing!

1151
01:33:50,501 --> 01:33:52,500
Or there's people sitting
in the waiting room

1152
01:33:52,601 --> 01:33:55,400
and they're... and they're...
like me, but prettier...

1153
01:33:55,501 --> 01:33:58,500
and better at the... because maybe
I'm not good enough!

1154
01:33:58,601 --> 01:34:00,900
- Yes, you are.
- No.

1155
01:34:01,201 --> 01:34:02,500
- No, maybe I'm not.
- Yes, you are.

1156
01:34:02,601 --> 01:34:03,800
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

1157
01:34:03,901 --> 01:34:06,300
- Maybe I'm not.
- You are.

1158
01:34:07,901 --> 01:34:09,500
Maybe I'm one
of those people that...

1159
01:34:09,501 --> 01:34:11,800
has always wanted to do it...

1160
01:34:11,801 --> 01:34:14,600
but it's like a pipe dream
for me,

1161
01:34:14,601 --> 01:34:15,800
you know? And then you...

1162
01:34:15,801 --> 01:34:19,200
You said it; you-you... change
your dreams and then you grow up.

1163
01:34:19,301 --> 01:34:21,800
Maybe I'm one of those people
and I'm not supposed to.

1164
01:34:21,801 --> 01:34:23,700
And I can go back to school...

1165
01:34:23,701 --> 01:34:26,000
and I can find something else
that I'm supposed to do.

1166
01:34:26,101 --> 01:34:28,800
'Cause I left...
to do that

1167
01:34:28,901 --> 01:34:32,700
and it's been six years.
And I don't wanna do it anymore.

1168
01:34:35,301 --> 01:34:37,000
Why?

1169
01:34:39,201 --> 01:34:42,500
- Why what?
- Why don't you wanna do it anymore?

1170
01:34:44,001 --> 01:34:47,200
'Cause I think it hurts
far a bit too much.

1171
01:34:48,801 --> 01:34:50,400
You're a baby.

1172
01:34:51,301 --> 01:34:52,700
- I'm not a baby,
- You are.

1173
01:34:52,801 --> 01:34:54,100
- I'm trying to grow up.
- You're crying like a baby.

1174
01:34:54,101 --> 01:34:55,100
Oh my God!

1175
01:34:55,101 --> 01:34:57,600
And you have an audition
tomorrow at 5:30.

1176
01:34:57,901 --> 01:35:00,200
I'll be out front at 8:00 am.

1177
01:35:00,601 --> 01:35:03,300
You'll be out front or not,
I don't know.

1178
01:35:04,501 --> 01:35:06,600
How did you find me here?

1179
01:35:07,401 --> 01:35:09,300
The house in front of the library.

1180
01:35:09,901 --> 01:35:12,900
Del Prado Library
Boulder City, NV

1181
01:35:52,501 --> 01:35:54,900
- I got coffee.
- Okay, great.

1182
01:36:13,001 --> 01:36:14,600
Mia?

1183
01:36:19,901 --> 01:36:22,300
Hi, Mia. I'm Amy
and this is Frank.

1184
01:36:22,401 --> 01:36:24,500
- Hi, how are you?
- Pleasure to meet you.

1185
01:36:24,601 --> 01:36:27,700
- Glad we found you.
- Me too.

1186
01:36:28,401 --> 01:36:33,200
The film shoots in Paris
and we don't have a script.

1187
01:36:33,901 --> 01:36:37,500
It's gonna be a process. We're gonna
build the character around the actress.

1188
01:36:37,601 --> 01:36:40,500
It's a three-month rehearsal
and a four-month shoot.

1189
01:36:42,201 --> 01:36:43,800
Okay.

1190
01:36:44,101 --> 01:36:47,600
And we thought that
you could just tell us a story.

1191
01:36:47,701 --> 01:36:51,500
- About?
- Hmm. You can just tell us anything.

1192
01:36:51,501 --> 01:36:52,600
Anything?

1193
01:36:52,601 --> 01:36:56,000
Yes. Just tell us a story.
You're a storyteller.

1194
01:36:56,901 --> 01:36:58,800
Uh...

1195
01:37:00,701 --> 01:37:02,900
Whenever you're ready.

1196
01:37:12,601 --> 01:37:15,400
My aunt used to live in Paris.

1197
01:37:19,801 --> 01:37:22,800
I remember she used to come home
and she would tell us...

1198
01:37:23,101 --> 01:37:27,300
these stories about...
being abroad and...

1199
01:37:28,801 --> 01:37:30,700
I remember...

1200
01:37:31,101 --> 01:37:35,200
she told us that
she jumped into the river once.

1201
01:37:36,501 --> 01:37:38,300
Barefoot.

1202
01:37:39,601 --> 01:37:42,000
She smiled...

1203
01:37:42,601 --> 01:37:44,400
<i>Leapt,</i>

1204
01:37:44,701 --> 01:37:47,200
<i>without looking</i>

1205
01:37:49,701 --> 01:37:57,500
<i>And tumbled into... the Seine</i>

1206
01:37:59,701 --> 01:38:03,800
<i>The water was freezing</i>

1207
01:38:03,901 --> 01:38:08,100
<i>She spent a month sneezing,</i>

1208
01:38:08,201 --> 01:38:14,300
<i>But said she would do it again</i>

1209
01:38:16,001 --> 01:38:22,700
<i>Here's to the ones who dream,</i>

1210
01:38:23,701 --> 01:38:30,400
<i>Foolish
as they may seem</i>

1211
01:38:31,401 --> 01:38:38,100
<i>Here's to the hearts
that ache</i>

1212
01:38:38,901 --> 01:38:45,700
<i>Here's to the mess
we make</i>

1213
01:38:46,801 --> 01:38:49,200
<i>She captured a feeling,</i>

1214
01:38:49,301 --> 01:38:52,400
<i>Sky with no ceiling,</i>

1215
01:38:52,501 --> 01:38:57,900
<i>The sunset inside a frame</i>

1216
01:38:59,001 --> 01:39:02,200
<i>She lived in her liquor</i>

1217
01:39:02,301 --> 01:39:05,600
<i>And died with a flicker</i>

1218
01:39:05,601 --> 01:39:11,600
<i>I'll always remember
the flame</i>

1219
01:39:12,101 --> 01:39:18,300
<i>Here's to the ones who dream,</i>

1220
01:39:18,301 --> 01:39:24,200
<i>Foolish
as they may seem</i>

1221
01:39:24,301 --> 01:39:30,300
<i>Here's to the hearts
that ache</i>

1222
01:39:30,401 --> 01:39:34,700
<i>Here's to the mess
we make</i>

1223
01:39:34,701 --> 01:39:38,300
<i>She told me:</i>

1224
01:39:38,401 --> 01:39:42,000
<i>"A bit of madness is key</i>

1225
01:39:42,301 --> 01:39:46,500
<i>to give us new colors to see</i>

1226
01:39:47,201 --> 01:39:51,700
<i>Who knows
where it will lead us?</i>

1227
01:39:51,801 --> 01:39:56,200
<i>And that's why
they need us"</i>

1228
01:39:56,201 --> 01:39:59,700
<i>So bring on the rebels,</i>

1229
01:39:59,701 --> 01:40:02,000
<i>The ripples
from pebbles,</i>

1230
01:40:02,101 --> 01:40:06,600
<i>The painters,
and poets and plays</i>

1231
01:40:06,701 --> 01:40:13,200
<i>And here's to the fools
who dream</i>

1232
01:40:13,301 --> 01:40:18,400
<i>Crazy
as they may seem</i>

1233
01:40:18,501 --> 01:40:23,700
<i>Here's to the hearts
that break</i>

1234
01:40:23,801 --> 01:40:30,400
<i>Here's to the mess...
we make</i>

1235
01:40:33,201 --> 01:40:39,300
<i>I trace it
all back to then,</i>

1236
01:40:41,301 --> 01:40:47,000
<i>Her, and the snow
and the Seine</i>

1237
01:40:49,601 --> 01:40:54,300
<i>Smiling through it</i>

1238
01:40:54,801 --> 01:41:00,200
<i>She said she'd do it...</i>

1239
01:41:02,001 --> 01:41:04,000
<i>again</i>

1240
01:41:17,801 --> 01:41:19,900
When do you find out?

1241
01:41:20,401 --> 01:41:22,800
Uh, they said
the next couple of days.

1242
01:41:22,901 --> 01:41:25,500
But I'm not expecting
to find anything out.

1243
01:41:25,601 --> 01:41:27,700
- You're gonna get it.
- I really might not.

1244
01:41:27,801 --> 01:41:29,300
- Yes, you are.
- And I don't want to be disappointed.

1245
01:41:29,301 --> 01:41:30,800
I know.

1246
01:41:30,801 --> 01:41:34,200
I know.
I know these things.

1247
01:41:36,101 --> 01:41:38,000
Where we are?

1248
01:41:40,701 --> 01:41:43,600
- Griffith Park.
- Where are we?

1249
01:41:43,601 --> 01:41:45,200
I know.

1250
01:41:46,701 --> 01:41:48,500
I don't know.

1251
01:41:51,001 --> 01:41:52,900
What do we do?

1252
01:41:53,301 --> 01:41:56,100
I don't think we can
do anything.

1253
01:41:56,101 --> 01:41:58,000
'Cause when you get this...

1254
01:41:58,001 --> 01:42:00,900
- If I get this.
- When you get this...

1255
01:42:02,101 --> 01:42:05,000
you gotta give it
everything you got.

1256
01:42:06,001 --> 01:42:09,800
Everything.
It's your dream.

1257
01:42:09,801 --> 01:42:11,700
What are you gonna do?

1258
01:42:11,701 --> 01:42:13,500
I gotta follow
my own plan, you know?

1259
01:42:13,601 --> 01:42:17,200
Stay here...
and get my own thing going.

1260
01:42:21,801 --> 01:42:23,800
You're gonna be in Paris...

1261
01:42:23,901 --> 01:42:26,000
Good jazz there.

1262
01:42:26,301 --> 01:42:28,800
And you love jazz now.

1263
01:42:29,901 --> 01:42:31,800
Right?

1264
01:42:32,801 --> 01:42:34,500
Yes.

1265
01:42:43,501 --> 01:42:46,800
And I guess we're just gonna have
to wait and see.

1266
01:42:54,701 --> 01:42:57,600
I'm always gonna love you.

1267
01:42:58,301 --> 01:43:01,100
I'm always gonna love you too.

1268
01:43:08,101 --> 01:43:10,000
Look at this view!

1269
01:43:11,801 --> 01:43:12,800
I've seen better.

1270
01:43:12,801 --> 01:43:13,900
- It's the worst.
- Yeah.

1271
01:43:13,901 --> 01:43:15,600
Yeah.

1272
01:43:18,501 --> 01:43:21,200
I've never been here
during the day.

1273
01:43:32,301 --> 01:43:37,400
WINTER

1274
01:43:45,701 --> 01:43:51,400
Five years later...

1275
01:44:13,101 --> 01:44:15,000
Hi. Can I have
two iced coffees, please?

1276
01:44:15,001 --> 01:44:16,000
Right, of course.

1277
01:44:16,001 --> 01:44:19,900
- On us.
- Oh! No, thank you. I insist.

1278
01:44:49,101 --> 01:44:51,000
Sounds good!

1279
01:44:51,101 --> 01:44:53,100
Harris did a good job.

1280
01:44:53,201 --> 01:44:54,200
It took him long enough.

1281
01:44:54,201 --> 01:44:57,900
It always does.
Signature time.

1282
01:44:59,601 --> 01:45:01,600
Not doing too bad, Seb.

1283
01:45:01,701 --> 01:45:03,300
"Not too bad" is great.

1284
01:45:03,401 --> 01:45:04,500
See ya tonight.

1285
01:45:04,601 --> 01:45:06,600
See you tonight.

1286
01:45:26,401 --> 01:45:28,000
Hi.

1287
01:45:28,001 --> 01:45:30,700
- How was your day?
- Good.

1288
01:45:34,501 --> 01:45:35,900
- How is she?
- She's great.

1289
01:45:36,001 --> 01:45:37,700
- Yeah?
- Yeah, come on.

1290
01:45:38,001 --> 01:45:39,600
Hi, buddy!

1291
01:45:40,501 --> 01:45:43,200
I didn't think
you were gonna be home yet.

1292
01:45:44,201 --> 01:45:45,700
Are you drawing?

1293
01:45:45,801 --> 01:45:46,800
Yeah.

1294
01:45:46,801 --> 01:45:50,300
Can I help?
You know I love to draw.

1295
01:46:05,201 --> 01:46:07,200

Okay, Chelsea, we're gonna go.

1299
01:46:34,501 --> 01:46:36,300
Bye, baby.

1300

Oh boy.

1305
01:46:57,801 --> 01:47:00,700
What if we miss this?
What're you gonna tell Natalie?

1306
01:47:01,301 --> 01:47:03,200
Maybe we'll just see her
back in New York.

1307
01:47:03,201 --> 01:47:04,700
Okay.

1308
01:47:06,501 --> 01:47:10,000
- I do not miss this.
- It's bad.

1309
01:47:15,801 --> 01:47:18,700
Do you wanna just pull off here
and get dinner?

1310
01:47:20,801 --> 01:47:22,000
- Sure, yeah.
- Yeah?

1311
01:47:22,101 --> 01:47:24,000
- Mm-hmm, yeah.
- Okay.

1312
01:47:52,301 --> 01:47:54,300
Do you wanna check it out?

1313
01:47:54,501 --> 01:47:56,000

No, we should go.
