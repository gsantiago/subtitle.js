Man.Of.Steel.2013.720p.BluRay.x264.YIFI

3
00:00:58,525 --> 00:01:00,027
Hurry!

4
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,979
Do you not understand?
Krypton's core is collapsing.

5
00:02:15,202 --> 00:02:18,547
We may only have a matter of weeks.
I warned you.

6
00:02:18,805 --> 00:02:22,309
Harvesting the core was suicide.
It has accelerated...

7
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:25,284
...the process of implosion.
- Our energy reserves...

8
00:02:25,512 --> 00:02:27,890
...were exhausted.
What would you have us do, El?

9
00:02:28,148 --> 00:02:31,561
Look to the stars, like our ancestors did.

10
00:02:31,818 --> 00:02:35,698
There are habitable worlds within reach.
We can begin by using the old outposts.

11
00:02:35,956 --> 00:02:39,665
Are you seriously suggesting
that we evacuate the entire planet?

12
00:02:39,893 --> 00:02:43,340
No. Everybody here is already dead.

13
00:02:44,164 --> 00:02:47,702
Give me control of the Codex.
I will ensure the survival of our race.

14
00:02:48,669 --> 00:02:49,739
There is still hope.

15
00:02:50,003 --> 00:02:52,506
I have held that hope in my hands.

16
00:03:07,421 --> 00:03:09,560
This council has been disbanded.

17
00:03:10,057 --> 00:03:11,900
On whose authority?

18
00:03:12,259 --> 00:03:13,397
Mine.

19
00:03:18,165 --> 00:03:21,442
The rest of you will be tried
and punished accordingly.

20
00:03:23,437 --> 00:03:26,008
- What are you doing, Zod? This is madness.
- What I should have done...

21
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:26,910
...years ago.

22
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,209
These lawmakers...

23
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,546
...with their endless debates...

24
00:03:29,776 --> 00:03:30,914
...have lead Krypton to ruin.

25
00:03:34,281 --> 00:03:35,954
And if your forces prevail...

26
00:03:36,216 --> 00:03:38,856
...you'll be the leader of nothing.
- Then join me.

27
00:03:39,086 --> 00:03:42,192
Help me save our race. We'll start anew.

28
00:03:42,422 --> 00:03:43,457
We'll sever...

29
00:03:43,724 --> 00:03:46,466
...the degenerative bloodlines
that led us to this state.

30
00:03:46,727 --> 00:03:49,970
And who will decide
which bloodlines survive, Zod?

31
00:03:51,531 --> 00:03:52,373
You?

32
00:03:54,901 --> 00:03:56,608
Don't do this, El.

33
00:03:56,870 --> 00:03:59,316
The last thing I want
is for us to be enemies.

34
00:03:59,573 --> 00:04:02,213
You have abandoned the principles
that bound us together.

35
00:04:02,442 --> 00:04:03,443
You've taken up the sword...

36
00:04:03,710 --> 00:04:05,917
...against your own people.

37
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,393
I will honor the man you once were, Zod...

38
00:04:09,816 --> 00:04:11,796
...not this monster you've become.

39
00:04:15,088 --> 00:04:16,431
Take him away.

40
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:23,939
Sir? Is everything all right?

41
00:04:24,164 --> 00:04:25,472
Out of the way.

42
00:04:26,333 --> 00:04:26,936
I said--

43
00:04:43,817 --> 00:04:44,852
Get me Lara.

44
00:04:46,186 --> 00:04:48,359
Jor. Behind you.

45
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,261
Lara, you have to ready the launch.

46
00:04:54,494 --> 00:04:56,167
I'll be with you as soon as I can.

47
00:05:10,977 --> 00:05:12,149
H'Raka!

48
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:24,992
Hyah!

49
00:05:51,585 --> 00:05:54,327
- Can you see the Codex?
- It's just beneath the central hub.

50
00:05:54,554 --> 00:05:55,692
But I'm compelled to warn you.

51
00:05:55,922 --> 00:05:58,232
Breaching the genesis chamber
is a Class-B crime--

52
00:05:58,491 --> 00:06:02,064
Nobody cares anymore, Kelex.
The world is about to come to an end.

53
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,901
Jar-El, by the authority of General Zed...

54
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,007
...surrender the Codex.

55
00:07:27,580 --> 00:07:28,615
Unh!

56
00:07:50,270 --> 00:07:51,340
Ahhh!

57
00:08:00,013 --> 00:08:01,549
Easy, H'Raka.

58
00:08:22,502 --> 00:08:23,742
Did you find a world?

59
00:08:24,337 --> 00:08:26,647
- We have.
- Orbiting a main sequence yellow star...

60
00:08:26,873 --> 00:08:28,181
“just as you said it would.

61
00:08:29,876 --> 00:08:31,480
A young star.

62
00:08:31,845 --> 00:08:33,518
His cells will drink its radiation.

63
00:08:36,649 --> 00:08:38,890
It's a seemingly intelligent population.

64
00:08:39,819 --> 00:08:40,889
He'll be an outcast.

65
00:08:41,888 --> 00:08:43,333
A freak.

66
00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:45,365
They'll kill him.

67
00:08:45,592 --> 00:08:47,037
How?

68
00:08:47,894 --> 00:08:49,100
He'll be a god to them.

69
00:08:51,431 --> 00:08:53,570
What if the ship doesn't make it?

70
00:08:54,534 --> 00:08:55,535
He'll die out there...

71
00:08:56,936 --> 00:08:58,279
...alone.

72
00:09:00,073 --> 00:09:01,848
I can't do it.

73
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,452
I thought I could, but...

74
00:09:03,710 --> 00:09:05,451
- Lara.
- ...now that he's here...

75
00:09:05,912 --> 00:09:07,619
Krypton is doomed.

76
00:09:08,848 --> 00:09:10,691
It's his only chance now.

77
00:09:11,384 --> 00:09:12,954
It's our people's only hope.

78
00:09:14,421 --> 00:09:15,627
What is it, Kelex?

79
00:09:15,889 --> 00:09:17,869
Five attack ships
converging from the east.

80
00:09:18,091 --> 00:09:20,435
Citadel's defenses
are being scanned and evaluated.

81
00:09:20,693 --> 00:09:21,603
I'll upload the Codex.

82
00:09:22,362 --> 00:09:23,773
No, wait.

83
00:09:24,397 --> 00:09:25,239
Lara.

84
00:09:25,465 --> 00:09:28,378
Just let me look at him.

85
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:34,274
We'll never get to see him walk.

86
00:09:36,709 --> 00:09:38,620
Never hear him say our names.

87
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:45,461
But out there...

88
00:09:45,718 --> 00:09:47,629
...amongst the stars...

89
00:09:48,988 --> 00:09:50,490
...he will live.

90
00:10:48,548 --> 00:10:49,856
Goodbye, my son.

91
00:10:51,184 --> 00:10:53,721
Our hopes and dreams travel with you.

92
00:11:32,425 --> 00:11:35,235
Concentrate fire on the main doors.

93
00:11:50,577 --> 00:11:51,555
Lady Lara.

94
00:11:51,778 --> 00:11:54,850
- The phantom drives are coming online.
- Proceed to ignition.

95
00:11:55,615 --> 00:11:56,616
General.

96
00:11:56,883 --> 00:12:00,262
We have identified an engine ignition
within the citadel.

97
00:12:01,221 --> 00:12:02,632
A launch.

98
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:06,202
Hold this platform, commander.

99
00:12:18,605 --> 00:12:20,551
I know you stole the Codex, Jor-El.

100
00:12:21,708 --> 00:12:22,709
Surrender it...

101
00:12:22,942 --> 00:12:24,944
...and I'll let you live.

102
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:28,115
This is a second chance for all of Krypton...

103
00:12:28,381 --> 00:12:30,725
...not just the bloodlines you deem worthy.

104
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:33,424
What have you done?

105
00:12:33,653 --> 00:12:35,963
We've had a child, Zod.

106
00:12:36,956 --> 00:12:38,333
A boy child.

107
00:12:38,591 --> 00:12:41,595
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

108
00:12:42,562 --> 00:12:44,269
And he will be free.

109
00:12:44,764 --> 00:12:47,244
Free to forge his own destiny.

110
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,580
Heresy.

111
00:12:51,471 --> 00:12:52,142
Destroy it.

112
00:13:01,147 --> 00:13:02,182
Ah!

113
00:13:45,625 --> 00:13:46,626
Lara...

114
00:13:46,793 --> 00:13:48,170
...listen to me.

115
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:52,035
The Codex is Krypton's future.

116
00:13:52,298 --> 00:13:54,744
Abort the launch.

117
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,695
No!

118
00:14:45,618 --> 00:14:46,892
Your son, Lara...

119
00:14:48,187 --> 00:14:50,098
...where have you sent him?

120
00:14:53,593 --> 00:14:55,368
His name...

121
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:56,699
...is Kal...

122
00:14:57,363 --> 00:14:59,206
...son of El.

123
00:15:02,301 --> 00:15:04,645
And he's beyond your reach.

124
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:16,783
Bring that ship down.

125
00:15:25,124 --> 00:15:26,501
Target locked.

126
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,682
Lay down your weapons.

127
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:42,010
Your forces are surrounded.

128
00:15:52,118 --> 00:15:53,597
General Zod...

129
00:15:53,820 --> 00:15:56,596
...for the crimes
of murder and high treason...

130
00:15:56,823 --> 00:16:00,032
...the Council has sentenced you
and your fellow insurgents...

131
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:04,664
...to three hundred cycles
of somatic reconditioning.

132
00:16:06,165 --> 00:16:07,974
Do you have any last words?

133
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:12,214
You won't kill us yourself!

134
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:15,845
You wouldn'l sully your hands!
But you'll damn us...

135
00:16:16,108 --> 00:16:18,281
...to a black hole for eternity!

136
00:16:20,346 --> 00:16:21,381
Jor-El was right.

137
00:16:21,647 --> 00:16:25,322
You're a pack of fools,
every last one of you.

138
00:16:26,219 --> 00:16:27,391
And you.

139
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:31,567
You believe your son is safe?

140
00:16:32,291 --> 00:16:33,998
I will find him.

141
00:16:34,227 --> 00:16:37,538
I will reclaim
what you have taken from us.

142
00:16:39,966 --> 00:16:41,536
I will find him.

143
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:44,840
I will find him, Lara.

144
00:16:47,907 --> 00:16:50,478
I will find him!

145
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:02,060
Argh!

146
00:18:31,677 --> 00:18:34,817
Lady Lara, shouldn't you find refuge?

147
00:18:35,615 --> 00:18:38,596
There is no refuge, Kelor.

148
00:18:39,518 --> 00:18:41,498
Jor-El was right.

149
00:18:43,923 --> 00:18:45,334
This is the end.

150
00:18:57,370 --> 00:19:00,283
Make a better world than ours, Kal.

151
00:20:32,431 --> 00:20:33,933
Watch it, dumb-ass!

152
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,703
Keep your eyes open
or you're gonna get squashed.

153
00:20:38,704 --> 00:20:41,150
Where the hell did they find you,
greenhorn?

154
00:20:41,407 --> 00:20:42,886
Let's get this trap in the air.

155
00:20:43,109 --> 00:20:44,645
Gentlemen, secure the deck.

156
00:20:44,910 --> 00:20:47,914
We just got a distress call
from a rig due west of us.

157
00:20:48,147 --> 00:20:49,455
Secure the deck.

158
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,723
All civilian boats, stand clear.

159
00:20:55,955 --> 00:20:58,629
The sub-sea valves failed
and the rig is about to explode.

160
00:20:58,891 --> 00:21:01,235
Roger, Coast Guard.
What about the men left inside?

161
00:21:01,460 --> 00:21:03,804
- Forget them. They're dead.
- Greenhorn...

162
00:21:04,063 --> 00:21:06,100
...fetch me my binoculars.

163
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:08,976
Greenhorn.

164
00:21:17,309 --> 00:21:20,847
This is the last of the oxygen. I don't know
how much longer we can hold out.

165
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,932
This is Coast Guard 6510.
We'll make one more pass then get out.

166
00:21:36,762 --> 00:21:38,867
Wait, wait.
I got some guys on the helipad.

167
00:21:39,131 --> 00:21:39,700
Right here!

168
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:47,148
Come on, come on! Let's go! Let's go!

169
00:21:47,339 --> 00:21:49,148
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

170
00:21:59,685 --> 00:22:00,857
Get that last guy loaded.

171
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:02,497
We have got to go.

172
00:22:02,721 --> 00:22:04,394
Hey, let's go. What are you doing?

173
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:11,633
Go! Go!

174
00:22:13,799 --> 00:22:14,834
Argh!

175
00:22:22,508 --> 00:22:24,010
Argh!

176
00:22:49,535 --> 00:22:51,572
"when Kansas became a territory?

177
00:22:53,772 --> 00:22:54,750
Clark.

178
00:22:56,742 --> 00:22:57,720
Are you listening, Clark?

179
00:23:02,915 --> 00:23:04,861
I asked if you could tell me who first...

180
00:23:05,084 --> 00:23:06,119
...settled Kansas.

181
00:23:19,365 --> 00:23:20,537
Are you all right, Clark?

182
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:30,385
Clark.

183
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:32,918
Clark.

184
00:23:36,482 --> 00:23:37,085
Clark!

185
00:23:41,086 --> 00:23:42,622
Clark, come out of there.

186
00:23:42,888 --> 00:23:44,231
Leave me alone.

187
00:23:45,257 --> 00:23:46,827
Clark, I have called your mother.

188
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:49,230
Clark?

189
00:23:51,063 --> 00:23:52,167
Ah!

190
00:23:52,331 --> 00:23:53,332
I'm here.

191
00:23:53,599 --> 00:23:55,579
Clark, honey, it's Mom.

192
00:23:57,970 --> 00:23:59,005
Will you open the door?

193
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:01,251
- What's wrong with him?
- He's such a freak.

194
00:24:01,473 --> 00:24:02,315
Crybaby.

195
00:24:02,574 --> 00:24:05,020
His parents won't even let him play
with other kids.

196
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,278
I know.

197
00:24:06,512 --> 00:24:07,354
Sweetie.

198
00:24:08,514 --> 00:24:10,653
How can I help you if you won't let me in?

199
00:24:10,916 --> 00:24:13,260
The world's too big, Mom.

200
00:24:13,485 --> 00:24:15,123
Then make it small.

201
00:24:17,489 --> 00:24:18,763
Just, um...

202
00:24:21,593 --> 00:24:22,697
...focus on my voice.

203
00:24:25,264 --> 00:24:27,210
Pretend ifs an island...

204
00:24:27,366 --> 00:24:29,277
...out in the ocean.

205
00:24:30,803 --> 00:24:32,111
Can you see it?

206
00:24:35,808 --> 00:24:36,843
I see it.

207
00:24:38,177 --> 00:24:40,179
Then swim towards it, honey.

208
00:24:53,459 --> 00:24:55,302
What's wrong with me, Mom?

209
00:24:57,896 --> 00:24:59,398
Clark.

210
00:24:59,665 --> 00:25:01,167
Clark.

211
00:25:29,828 --> 00:25:31,705
- Did you get everything I need?
- Yep.

212
00:25:31,930 --> 00:25:33,603
Hold it, hold it.

213
00:26:23,449 --> 00:26:24,985
Hey, ass-wipe.

214
00:26:25,551 --> 00:26:27,224
What do you think? You see the game?

215
00:26:27,453 --> 00:26:29,956
- Leave him alone, Pete.
- What are you, his girlfriend?

216
00:26:30,222 --> 00:26:31,895
I wanna hear what he has to say.

217
00:26:34,259 --> 00:26:34,930
Come on...

218
00:26:35,160 --> 00:26:35,831
...dick-splash.

219
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:58,458
Mos SCREAMING]

220
00:28:16,828 --> 00:28:17,829
My son was there.

221
00:28:18,063 --> 00:28:20,270
He was in the bus.

222
00:28:20,532 --> 00:28:23,342
- He saw what Clark did.
- I know he did.

223
00:28:24,269 --> 00:28:28,274
- I'm sure what he thought he saw was--
- Was an act of God, Jonathan.

224
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,719
This was providence.

225
00:28:35,447 --> 00:28:37,518
I think you're blowing it out of proportion.

226
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:41,026
No, I'm not. Lana saw it too.

227
00:28:41,253 --> 00:28:42,254
And the Fordham boy.

228
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,727
This isn't the first time...

229
00:28:43,956 --> 00:28:45,902
...Clark's done something like this.

230
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,083
I just wanted to help.

231
00:29:03,542 --> 00:29:06,284
I know you did, but we talked about this.

232
00:29:06,545 --> 00:29:07,819
Right?

233
00:29:08,280 --> 00:29:10,988
Right? We talked about this. You have...

234
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:14,930
Clark, you have to keep this side
of yourself a secret.

235
00:29:15,387 --> 00:29:19,267
What was I supposed to do?
Just let them die?

236
00:29:24,062 --> 00:29:25,473
Maybe.

237
00:29:27,399 --> 00:29:31,404
There's more at stake here than just our lives,
Clark, or the lives of those around us.

238
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:35,750
When the world...

239
00:29:36,675 --> 00:29:40,680
When the world finds out what you can do
it's gonna change everything. Our...

240
00:29:40,946 --> 00:29:43,517
Our beliefs, our notions of...

241
00:29:43,782 --> 00:29:46,490
...what it means to be human.
Everything.

242
00:29:46,752 --> 00:29:49,528
You saw how Pete's mom reacted, right?

243
00:29:49,788 --> 00:29:51,995
She was scared, Clark.

244
00:29:53,125 --> 00:29:53,967
Why?

245
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:58,671
People are afraid
of what they don't understand.

246
00:29:58,930 --> 00:29:59,840
Is she right?

247
00:30:01,967 --> 00:30:03,810
Did God do this to me?

248
00:30:05,370 --> 00:30:06,872
Tell me.

249
00:30:21,653 --> 00:30:23,326
We found you in this.

250
00:30:25,290 --> 00:30:28,237
We were sure the government
was gonna show up on our doorstep...

251
00:30:28,493 --> 00:30:30,473
...but no one ever came.

252
00:30:44,976 --> 00:30:46,649
This was in that chamber with you.

253
00:30:49,181 --> 00:30:50,558
I took it to a metallurgist...

254
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:52,159
...at Kansas State.

255
00:30:52,384 --> 00:30:54,990
He said whatever it was made from
didn't even...

256
00:30:55,921 --> 00:30:58,697
Didn't even exist on the periodic table.

257
00:31:00,659 --> 00:31:01,831
That's another way of saying...

258
00:31:02,060 --> 00:31:04,336
...that it's not from this world, Clark.

259
00:31:06,431 --> 00:31:07,705
And neither are you.

260
00:31:10,402 --> 00:31:11,938
You're the answer, son.

261
00:31:12,204 --> 00:31:14,582
You're the answer to
"Are we alone in the universe?"

262
00:31:16,742 --> 00:31:18,187
I don't wanna be.

263
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:20,287
And I don't blame you, son.

264
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:23,587
It'd be a huge burden for anyone to bear.

265
00:31:23,849 --> 00:31:27,262
But you're not just anyone, Clark,
and I have to believe that you were...

266
00:31:28,420 --> 00:31:30,263
That you were sent here for a reason.

267
00:31:31,523 --> 00:31:34,094
All these changes that you're
going through, one day...

268
00:31:34,359 --> 00:31:37,704
One day you're gonna think of them
as a blessing. When that day comes...

269
00:31:37,929 --> 00:31:39,374
...you have to make a choice.

270
00:31:39,598 --> 00:31:43,603
A choice of whether to stand proud
in front of the human race or not.

271
00:31:45,370 --> 00:31:48,044
Can't I just keep pretending I'm your son?

272
00:31:48,740 --> 00:31:50,651
You are my son.

273
00:31:55,113 --> 00:31:57,115
But somewhere out there you've...

274
00:31:57,816 --> 00:32:01,059
You have another father too,
who gave you another name.

275
00:32:04,122 --> 00:32:04,964
And he sent you here...

276
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:06,998
...for a reason, Clark.

277
00:32:08,760 --> 00:32:12,435
And even if it takes you the rest of your life,
you owe it to yourself...

278
00:32:12,664 --> 00:32:14,803
...to find out what that reason is.

279
00:32:23,008 --> 00:32:26,854
Bound by wild desire

280
00:32:27,078 --> 00:32:30,116
I fell into a ring of fire

281
00:32:30,282 --> 00:32:32,455
Wait a second.
Aren't you here fer the exercise?

282
00:32:32,684 --> 00:32:34,357
No, there was a change in the plans.

283
00:32:34,619 --> 00:32:36,690
Somebody found something
strange on Ellesmere.

284
00:32:37,255 --> 00:32:39,929
- Aircom's making runs out there all week.
- That rat hole?

285
00:32:40,158 --> 00:32:42,263
- You gotta be kidding me.
- I know. It's crazy.

286
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:44,201
The Americans are there too,
lots of them.

287
00:32:44,463 --> 00:32:47,034
- Anything else?
- They're calling it an anomalous object.

288
00:32:47,299 --> 00:32:49,540
- Whatever that means.
- Back off, Ludlow. I'm serious.

289
00:32:49,801 --> 00:32:51,610
- Oh, come on, Chrissy.
- Knock it off.

290
00:32:51,837 --> 00:32:53,282
- Sit down.
- Let me go.

291
00:32:53,505 --> 00:32:55,178
Hey. Leave her alone, man.

292
00:32:59,511 --> 00:33:01,218
Or what, tough guy?

293
00:33:01,780 --> 00:33:05,193
Or I'm gonna have to ask you to leave.

294
00:33:06,384 --> 00:33:09,456
I think I'll probably just leave
when I'm good and ready.

295
00:33:11,957 --> 00:33:12,731
Ooh.

296
00:33:19,397 --> 00:33:21,070
Oh, there he is.

297
00:33:28,373 --> 00:33:30,375
It's not worth it, sweetie.

298
00:33:38,517 --> 00:33:40,895
Hey, asshole, don't forget your tip.

299
00:33:43,054 --> 00:33:44,863
Strike.

300
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:36,818
Thanks.

301
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:38,882
Hi.

302
00:34:39,110 --> 00:34:40,817
Miss Lane. How you doing?

303
00:34:41,079 --> 00:34:43,286
- Good.
- Jed Eubanks, Arctic Cargo.

304
00:34:43,548 --> 00:34:45,789
How far to the station?

305
00:34:46,251 --> 00:34:49,323
- Camp's just over the rise. I'll walk you over.
- Great.

306
00:34:49,588 --> 00:34:51,795
Joe can take your bags. Joe.

307
00:34:52,057 --> 00:34:53,297
Help her out.

308
00:34:53,558 --> 00:34:56,061
Careful with those. They're heavy.

309
00:34:58,496 --> 00:35:00,134
I gotta confess, Miss Lane...

310
00:35:00,398 --> 00:35:03,242
...I'm not a fan of the Daily Planet.

311
00:35:03,635 --> 00:35:07,606
But those pieces you wrote when you were
embedded with the 1st Division were...

312
00:35:07,839 --> 00:35:09,682
Well, they were pretty impressive.

313
00:35:09,941 --> 00:35:13,912
Well, what can I say? I get writer's block
if I'm not wearing a flak jacket.

314
00:35:19,618 --> 00:35:20,619
Miss Lane.

315
00:35:20,852 --> 00:35:23,492
I'm Colonel Hardy, U.S. Northcom.
Dr. Emil Hamilton...

316
00:35:23,755 --> 00:35:24,859
...from DARPA.

317
00:35:25,123 --> 00:35:26,295
- You're early.
- Hi.

318
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:28,003
We were expecting you tomorrow.

319
00:35:28,259 --> 00:35:30,705
Which is why I showed up today.

320
00:35:31,363 --> 00:35:33,536
Look, let's get one thing straight,
guys, okay?

321
00:35:33,798 --> 00:35:36,642
The only reason I'm here
is because we're on Canadian soil...

322
00:35:36,868 --> 00:35:40,315
...and the appellate court overruled
your injunction to keep me away.

323
00:35:40,538 --> 00:35:42,677
So if we're done measuring dicks...

324
00:35:42,941 --> 00:35:45,285
...can you have your people
show me what you found?

325
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:48,483
NA SA's EOS satellites...

326
00:35:48,713 --> 00:35:50,488
...pinged the anomaly first.

327
00:35:50,715 --> 00:35:53,195
The ice shelf plays hell
on the echo soundings.

328
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:55,795
- But there's something there.
- A submarine, maybe?

329
00:35:56,021 --> 00:35:56,829
Soviet-era?

330
00:35:57,055 --> 00:35:58,659
Doubtful. That's 300 meters.

331
00:35:58,890 --> 00:36:01,871
Considerably larger than anything
we know they built back then.

332
00:36:02,127 --> 00:36:03,367
But herds the spooky pan.

333
00:36:04,562 --> 00:36:07,042
The ice surrounding the object...

334
00:36:07,298 --> 00:36:10,370
...it's nearly twenty thousand years old.

335
00:36:11,836 --> 00:36:12,678
Miss Lane?

336
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,313
Try not to wander.

337
00:36:15,540 --> 00:36:18,646
Temperatures drop to minus 40
at night around here.

338
00:36:18,877 --> 00:36:21,153
Wouldn't find your body till after spring.

339
00:36:24,149 --> 00:36:25,651
And there you go.

340
00:36:29,220 --> 00:36:30,699
What if I need to tinkle?

341
00:36:31,389 --> 00:36:33,027
There's a bucket in the corner.

342
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:09,398
Where the hell are you going?

343
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,100
Hello'?

344
00:40:55,586 --> 00:40:58,692
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's all right.

345
00:41:13,004 --> 00:41:14,881
You're hemorrhaging internally...

346
00:41:15,139 --> 00:41:17,517
...and if I don't cauterize this bleed...

347
00:41:18,676 --> 00:41:19,347
How can-l?

348
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,147
I can do things that other people can't.

349
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,285
Now hold my hand.

350
00:41:25,116 --> 00:41:26,686
This is gonna hurt.

351
00:42:28,379 --> 00:42:30,518
What Colonel Hardy
and his team surmised...

352
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:32,250
...was a Soviet-era submarine...

353
00:42:32,517 --> 00:42:34,963
...was actually something
much more exotic.

354
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,065
An isotope analysis of the surrounding
ice bores suggests that an object...

355
00:42:39,290 --> 00:42:43,136
...had been trapped in the glacier
for over 18, 000 years.

356
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:44,930
As for my rescuer?

357
00:42:45,196 --> 00:42:47,574
He disappeared during
the object's departure.

358
00:42:47,965 --> 00:42:50,377
A background check revealed
that his work history...

359
00:42:50,601 --> 00:42:52,706
...and identity had been falsified.

360
00:42:52,937 --> 00:42:54,814
The questions raised by my rescuer's...

361
00:42:55,073 --> 00:42:56,916
"existence are frightening to contemplate...

362
00:42:57,141 --> 00:42:58,779
...but I also know what I saw.

363
00:43:00,711 --> 00:43:03,282
"And I have arrived
at the inescapable conclusion...

364
00:43:03,548 --> 00:43:05,550
...that the object and its occupant...

365
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,729
...did not originate on Earth."

366
00:43:09,454 --> 00:43:12,765
I can't print this, Lois.
You might have hallucinated half of it.

367
00:43:12,990 --> 00:43:15,095
What about the contractors
who corroborated...

368
00:43:15,326 --> 00:43:18,500
...my story?
- The Pentagon is denying that there was a ship.

369
00:43:18,763 --> 00:43:20,606
Of course they are. They're supposed to.

370
00:43:20,832 --> 00:43:22,334
It's the Pentagon.

371
00:43:22,600 --> 00:43:24,273
Perry, it's me we're talking about.

372
00:43:24,502 --> 00:43:27,176
- I'm a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter.
- Then act like it.

373
00:43:27,438 --> 00:43:29,577
- Print it or I walk.
- You can't.

374
00:43:29,807 --> 00:43:30,842
You're under contract.

375
00:43:33,311 --> 00:43:37,316
I'm not running a story
about aliens walking among us.

376
00:43:43,621 --> 00:43:45,191
Never gonna happen.

377
00:43:48,459 --> 00:43:50,837
That's a Scotch, straight-up, for the lady.

378
00:43:51,095 --> 00:43:52,369
I'm sending you the article.

379
00:43:52,630 --> 00:43:55,110
My editor won't print it,
but if it leaked online...

380
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:56,641
Got it.

381
00:43:56,868 --> 00:43:59,314
But didn't you once describe my site...

382
00:43:59,537 --> 00:44:02,347
...as a creeping cancer of falsehoods?

383
00:44:02,940 --> 00:44:05,511
I stand by my words, Woodburn,
but I want this story...

384
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:06,948
...out there.
- Why?

385
00:44:07,979 --> 00:44:11,324
Because I want my mystery man
to know I know the truth.

386
00:44:25,663 --> 00:44:27,643
Recursive diagnostics complete.

387
00:44:28,466 --> 00:44:30,673
Guiding presence authenticated.

388
00:44:30,902 --> 00:44:33,473
All systems operational.

389
00:44:45,550 --> 00:44:49,498
To see you standing there
having grown into an adult...

390
00:44:51,722 --> 00:44:53,565
If only Lara could have witnessed this.

391
00:44:54,692 --> 00:44:55,898
Who are you?

392
00:44:56,894 --> 00:44:58,874
I am your father, Kal.

393
00:45:00,231 --> 00:45:02,108
Or at least a shadow of him.

394
00:45:02,600 --> 00:45:04,341
His consciousness.

395
00:45:06,103 --> 00:45:09,209
My name was Jor-El.

396
00:45:11,876 --> 00:45:13,514
And Kal?

397
00:45:16,747 --> 00:45:17,953
That's my name.

398
00:45:18,849 --> 00:45:22,058
It is.

399
00:45:22,753 --> 00:45:24,790
I have so many questions.

400
00:45:27,525 --> 00:45:29,129
Where do I come from?

401
00:45:30,861 --> 00:45:32,738
Why did you send me here?

402
00:45:33,564 --> 00:45:35,441
You came from Krypton.

403
00:45:38,135 --> 00:45:42,140
A world with a much harsher environment
than Earths.

404
00:45:45,943 --> 00:45:47,581
Long ago...

405
00:45:47,812 --> 00:45:50,053
...in an era of expansion...

406
00:45:50,281 --> 00:45:53,490
...our race spread out through the stars...

407
00:45:53,751 --> 00:45:56,459
...seeking new worlds to settle upon.

408
00:45:57,588 --> 00:46:01,092
This scout ship was
one of thousands launched into the void.

409
00:46:03,661 --> 00:46:06,267
We built outposts on other planets...

410
00:46:06,497 --> 00:46:10,240
musing great machines to reshape
environments to our needs.

411
00:46:12,436 --> 00:46:16,441
For 100,000 years,
our civilization ﬂourished...

412
00:46:17,975 --> 00:46:19,977
...accomplishing wonders.

413
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,783
What happened?

414
00:46:24,782 --> 00:46:27,854
Artificial population control
was established.

415
00:46:28,586 --> 00:46:32,193
The outposts on space exploration
were abandoned.

416
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:35,361
We exhausted our natural resources.

417
00:46:35,626 --> 00:46:39,631
As a result,
our planet's core became unstable.

418
00:46:42,099 --> 00:46:44,636
Eventually, our military leader...

419
00:46:44,869 --> 00:46:48,783
...General Zod, attempted a coup.

420
00:46:50,708 --> 00:46:52,881
But by then it was too late.

421
00:46:54,145 --> 00:46:56,785
Your mother and I foresaw
the coming calamity...

422
00:46:57,014 --> 00:46:59,824
...and we took certain steps
to ensure your survival.

423
00:47:01,886 --> 00:47:03,524
This is a genesis chamber.

424
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:07,528
All Kryptonians were conceived
in chambers such as this.

425
00:47:07,792 --> 00:47:11,501
Every child was designed to fulfill
a pare-determined role in our society...

426
00:47:11,729 --> 00:47:12,571
...as a worker...

427
00:47:12,830 --> 00:47:15,970
...a warrior, a leader and so on.

428
00:47:16,200 --> 00:47:19,477
Your mother and I believed Krypton
lost something precious.

429
00:47:19,704 --> 00:47:21,911
The element of choice, of chance.

430
00:47:22,406 --> 00:47:24,579
What if a child dreamed
of becoming something...

431
00:47:24,842 --> 00:47:27,345
mother than what society
had intended for him or her?

432
00:47:28,879 --> 00:47:31,485
What if a child aspired
to something greater?

433
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:34,251
You were the embodiment
of that belief, Kal.

434
00:47:34,518 --> 00:47:36,998
Krypton's first natural birth in centuries.

435
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,763
That's why we risked so much to save you.

436
00:47:41,892 --> 00:47:43,337
Why didn't you come with me?

437
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:48,605
We couldn't, Kal.

438
00:47:49,667 --> 00:47:50,668
No matter how much...

439
00:47:50,901 --> 00:47:52,107
...we wanted to.

440
00:47:52,603 --> 00:47:54,605
No matter how much we loved you.

441
00:47:55,373 --> 00:47:56,750
Your mother, Lara, and I...

442
00:47:57,007 --> 00:48:00,113
...were a product of the failures
of our world as much as Zod was...

443
00:48:00,378 --> 00:48:02,051
...tied to its fate.

444
00:48:02,279 --> 00:48:04,350
- So I'm alone.
- No.

445
00:48:06,083 --> 00:48:09,758
You're as much a child of Earth now
as you are of Krypton.

446
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:13,194
You can embody the best of both worlds.

447
00:48:13,424 --> 00:48:17,065
A dream your mother and I
dedicated our lives to preserve.

448
00:48:21,599 --> 00:48:24,580
The people of Earth
are different from us, it's true.

449
00:48:24,802 --> 00:48:27,749
But, ultimately,
I believe that's a good thing.

450
00:48:27,972 --> 00:48:30,418
They won't necessarily
make the same mistakes we did.

451
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:32,621
Not if you guide them, Kal.

452
00:48:34,211 --> 00:48:36,248
Not if you give them hope.

453
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,823
That's what this symbol means.

454
00:48:42,553 --> 00:48:44,897
The symbol of the house of El
means hope.

455
00:48:45,122 --> 00:48:47,625
Embodied within that hope
is the fundamental belief...

456
00:48:47,892 --> 00:48:51,806
...in the potential of every person
to be a force for good.

457
00:48:52,930 --> 00:48:54,967
That's what you can bring them.

458
00:49:15,152 --> 00:49:16,995
Why am I so different from them?

459
00:49:18,255 --> 00:49:20,758
Earth's sun is younger and brighter
than Krypton's was.

460
00:49:22,660 --> 00:49:25,038
Your cells have drunken its radiation...

461
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:29,301
“strengthening your muscles,
your skin, your senses.

462
00:49:29,834 --> 00:49:33,839
Earth's gravity is weaker,
yet its atmosphere is more nourishing.

463
00:49:35,139 --> 00:49:38,143
You've grown stronger here
than I ever could have imagined.

464
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,979
The only way to know how strong...

465
00:49:41,045 --> 00:49:44,185
...is to keep testing your limits.

466
00:50:02,967 --> 00:50:03,638
Unh!

467
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:13,185
Uh-- Oh.

468
00:50:14,812 --> 00:50:16,086
Whoa!

469
00:50:36,433 --> 00:50:40,438
You will give the people ofEart/v
an ideal to strive towards.

470
00:50:42,106 --> 00:50:43,915
They'll race behind you.

471
00:50:44,174 --> 00:50:45,551
They will stumble.

472
00:50:45,776 --> 00:50:46,914
They will fall.

473
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:48,884
But in time...

474
00:50:50,414 --> 00:50:53,054
...they will join you in the sun, Kal.

475
00:50:54,552 --> 00:50:56,259
In time...

476
00:50:56,587 --> 00:50:59,193
you will help them accomplish wonders.

477
00:52:21,605 --> 00:52:25,553
How do you find someone who has
spent a lifetime covering his tracks?

478
00:52:25,943 --> 00:52:27,547
You start with the urban legends...

479
00:52:27,811 --> 00:52:30,155
- ...that have sprung up in his wake.
- That's Joe.

480
00:52:30,381 --> 00:52:31,792
The friends of a friend...

481
00:52:32,016 --> 00:52:34,018
- ...who have seen him.
- He worked here.

482
00:52:34,284 --> 00:52:37,128
For some he was a guardian angel.
For others, a cipher...

483
00:52:37,354 --> 00:52:39,129
...a ghost who never quite fit in.

484
00:52:40,024 --> 00:52:41,503
Well, I was saying we were...

485
00:52:41,725 --> 00:52:42,965
...coming towards the oil rig.

486
00:52:43,193 --> 00:52:46,333
As you work your way back in time,
the stories form a pattern.

487
00:52:47,064 --> 00:52:49,135
I'm looking for a Pete Ross.
Do you know him?

488
00:52:49,366 --> 00:52:52,210
Yeah, he works at the IHOP.
If you go down the road...

489
00:52:54,138 --> 00:52:54,843
Pete Ross?

490
00:52:57,174 --> 00:53:00,383
I'd like to talk to you about an accident
when you were younger.

491
00:53:00,644 --> 00:53:03,147
A school bus that went into the river.

492
00:53:08,652 --> 00:53:10,757
Dusty. Shh-shh-shh.

493
00:53:10,921 --> 00:53:11,991
Mrs. Kent?

494
00:53:12,923 --> 00:53:14,869
I'm Lois Lane. I'm from the Daily Planet.

495
00:53:15,926 --> 00:53:16,666
Quiet.

496
00:53:18,262 --> 00:53:21,732
I'm from the Daily Planet
and I'd like to talk to you about your son.

497
00:53:39,850 --> 00:53:43,855
I figured if I turned over enough stones
you'd eventually find me.

498
00:53:49,426 --> 00:53:52,464
Where are you from?
What are you doing here?

499
00:53:52,730 --> 00:53:54,073
Let me tell your story.

500
00:53:54,298 --> 00:53:57,438
What if I don't want my story told?

501
00:53:57,701 --> 00:53:59,476
It's going to come out eventually.

502
00:53:59,737 --> 00:54:02,775
Somebody's going to get a photograph
or figure out where you live.

503
00:54:03,040 --> 00:54:05,987
- Then I'll disappear again.
- The only way you could disappear...

504
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:10,248
...is to stop helping people altogether,
and I sense that's not an option for you.

505
00:54:14,418 --> 00:54:18,423
My father believed that if the world
found out who I really was...

506
00:54:20,424 --> 00:54:21,425
...they'd reject me...

507
00:54:22,159 --> 00:54:23,797
...out of fear.

508
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:27,900
I'm tired of safe.

509
00:54:28,132 --> 00:54:30,237
I just wanna do something useful
with my life.

510
00:54:30,467 --> 00:54:33,073
So farming, feeding people.
That's not useful?

511
00:54:33,303 --> 00:54:34,145
I didn't say that.

512
00:54:34,404 --> 00:54:36,509
Our family's been farming
for five generations.

513
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:38,685
Your family, not mine.

514
00:54:38,942 --> 00:54:41,923
I don't even know why I'm listening to you.
You're not my dad.

515
00:54:42,146 --> 00:54:43,523
You're just some guy
who found me in a field.

516
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:44,953
Clark.

517
00:54:47,317 --> 00:54:48,990
It's all right, Martha.

518
00:54:50,821 --> 00:54:52,926
He's right. Clark has a point.

519
00:54:53,490 --> 00:54:54,525
We're not your parents.

520
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,334
But we've been doing the best we can.

521
00:54:58,595 --> 00:55:01,974
And we've been making this up
as we go along, so maybe...

522
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,611
Maybe our best
isn't good enough anymore.

523
00:55:09,640 --> 00:55:11,677
Look, Dad--

524
00:55:11,942 --> 00:55:13,387
Hold on.

525
00:55:33,130 --> 00:55:34,837
Go for the overpass.

526
00:55:36,633 --> 00:55:37,737
Go for the overpass!

527
00:55:40,070 --> 00:55:41,708
Take cover! Take cover!

528
00:55:41,972 --> 00:55:44,350
- Over there. Just follow them.
- Take cover.

529
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:49,250
She's stuck.

530
00:55:53,817 --> 00:55:55,694
Hank's still in the car.

531
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:57,555
Hank's in the car.

532
00:55:58,422 --> 00:56:00,561
- I'll get him, I'll get him.
- No, no.

533
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:03,332
Get your mom to the overpass.

534
00:56:21,712 --> 00:56:23,521
Hank! Hank! Come!

535
00:56:32,422 --> 00:56:33,628
Jonathan!
- Mom, ifs okay.

536
00:56:54,645 --> 00:56:56,090
- Jonathan!
- Mom, stay here.

537
00:57:21,905 --> 00:57:24,408
Dad!

538
00:57:26,944 --> 00:57:30,016
I let my father die because I trusted him.

539
00:57:30,914 --> 00:57:34,828
Because he was convinced
that I had to wait.

540
00:57:35,585 --> 00:57:37,758
That the world was not ready.

541
00:57:39,489 --> 00:57:41,127
What do you think?

542
00:57:46,029 --> 00:57:47,667
You better watch out, Lois.

543
00:57:48,165 --> 00:57:50,475
Hey, Perry's gunning for you.

544
00:57:50,701 --> 00:57:54,478
He knows you're Woodburns anonymous
source and cannot wait to rip you a new one.

545
00:57:56,840 --> 00:57:58,285
Oh, look at her. Ha, ha, ha.

546
00:58:00,277 --> 00:58:02,814
I told you not to run with this,
and what do you do?

547
00:58:03,046 --> 00:58:05,549
You let Wood burn just shotgun it
all over the Internet.

548
00:58:05,816 --> 00:58:08,695
Now the publishers want me to sue you.

549
00:58:08,952 --> 00:58:12,195
Well, if it makes a difference,
I'm dropping it.

550
00:58:12,456 --> 00:58:13,457
Whoa, just like that?

551
00:58:13,690 --> 00:58:14,691
Yep.

552
00:58:15,058 --> 00:58:16,366
What happened to your leads?

553
00:58:17,027 --> 00:58:19,667
They didn't pan out. The story is smoke.

554
00:58:19,896 --> 00:58:21,842
Or it didn't get the traction you hoped?

555
00:58:24,201 --> 00:58:25,043
Two weeks leave...

556
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:26,906
...no pay, that's your penance.

557
00:58:27,170 --> 00:58:28,843
You try something like this again...

558
00:58:29,072 --> 00:58:30,745
...you're done here.
- Fine.

559
00:58:31,008 --> 00:58:33,716
Let's make it three weeks
since you're so willing to agree.

560
00:58:33,977 --> 00:58:35,479
- Perry.
- No, no. Don't. Don't.

561
00:58:37,147 --> 00:58:38,820
I believe you saw something, Lois.

562
00:58:39,316 --> 00:58:42,320
But not for a moment do I believe
that your leads just went cold.

563
00:58:42,552 --> 00:58:46,056
So whatever your reasons are
for dropping it...

564
00:58:47,090 --> 00:58:48,933
...I think you're doing the right thing.

565
00:58:49,493 --> 00:58:50,733
Why?

566
00:58:52,095 --> 00:58:55,736
Can you imagine how people
on this planet would react...

567
00:58:58,001 --> 00:59:01,448
...if they knew there was
someone like this out there?

568
00:59:19,589 --> 00:59:20,590
Go get him.

569
00:59:27,431 --> 00:59:29,069
Well, look at you.

570
00:59:46,116 --> 00:59:47,925
A reporter came by here.

571
00:59:48,485 --> 00:59:50,726
She's a friend. Don't worry.

572
00:59:51,455 --> 00:59:52,798
Oh.

573
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:54,599
Mom.

574
00:59:54,758 --> 00:59:56,499
- Heh, heh, heh.
- What'?

575
00:59:57,961 --> 01:00:00,498
- I found them.
- Who?

576
01:00:01,331 --> 01:00:02,833
My parents.

577
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:05,343
My People.

578
01:00:06,236 --> 01:00:09,445
I know where I come from now.

579
01:00:10,841 --> 01:00:12,115
Wow.

580
01:00:13,176 --> 01:00:14,951
That's wonderful.

581
01:00:16,813 --> 01:00:19,259
I'm so happy for you, Clark.

582
01:00:28,091 --> 01:00:30,628
What?
- it's nothing.

583
01:00:33,330 --> 01:00:36,277
When you were a baby I used to lay
by your crib at night...

584
01:00:36,500 --> 01:00:38,878
...listening to you breathe.

585
01:00:39,936 --> 01:00:41,540
It was hard for you.

586
01:00:42,772 --> 01:00:44,149
You struggled.

587
01:00:44,374 --> 01:00:46,217
And I worried all the time.

588
01:00:46,476 --> 01:00:48,319
You worried the truth would come out.

589
01:00:49,846 --> 01:00:51,052
No.

590
01:00:52,015 --> 01:00:54,621
The truth about you is beautiful.

591
01:00:55,051 --> 01:00:58,498
We saw that the moment
we laid eyes on you.

592
01:01:00,790 --> 01:01:04,795
We knew that one day,
the whole world would see that.

593
01:01:07,230 --> 01:01:08,868
I'm just...

594
01:01:09,499 --> 01:01:11,570
I'm worried they'll take you away from me.

595
01:01:13,803 --> 01:01:16,181
I'm not going anywhere, Mom.

596
01:01:18,008 --> 01:01:19,510
I promise.

597
01:01:25,715 --> 01:01:27,888
General Swanwick, sir.

598
01:01:28,151 --> 01:01:31,894
What am I looking at, doc?
Comet? Asteroid?

599
01:01:33,056 --> 01:01:37,061
Comets don't make
course corrections, general.

600
01:01:39,863 --> 01:01:43,868
Wanted you to see this before some amateur
with a telescope creates a worldwide panic.

601
01:01:45,535 --> 01:01:46,912
The ship appears to have...

602
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:49,912
...inserted itself into
a lunar synchronous orbit...

603
01:01:50,173 --> 01:01:52,346
...though I have no idea why.

604
01:01:52,576 --> 01:01:55,420
Have you tried... communicating with it?

605
01:01:55,679 --> 01:01:59,684
Well, they haven't responded as of yet.

606
01:02:00,951 --> 01:02:04,956
I'm just speculating, but I think
whoever? at the helm of that thing...

607
01:02:05,222 --> 01:02:07,725
...is looking to make a dramatic entrance.

608
01:02:14,598 --> 01:02:16,043
Anybody know where we keep the toner?

609
01:02:17,033 --> 01:02:18,944
- What's going on?
- it's all over the news.

610
01:02:19,202 --> 01:02:21,148
You gotta see this.

611
01:02:48,131 --> 01:02:49,633
Clark.

612
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:51,138
Yeah?

613
01:02:51,401 --> 01:02:52,744
Coming.

614
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:55,106
This is a breaking news. An unidentified...

615
01:03:36,980 --> 01:03:39,051
You are not alone.

616
01:03:40,717 --> 01:03:43,061
You are not alone.

617
01:03:44,988 --> 01:03:47,229
You are not alone.

618
01:03:52,896 --> 01:03:55,502
You are not alone.

619
01:04:20,924 --> 01:04:22,426
It's coming in on the RSS feeds.

620
01:04:22,692 --> 01:04:24,569
You are not alone.

621
01:04:25,195 --> 01:04:27,232
It's on my phone too.

622
01:04:29,399 --> 01:04:31,845
My name is General Zod.

623
01:04:33,670 --> 01:04:36,446
Icome from a world far from yours.

624
01:04:37,841 --> 01:04:41,846
I have journeyed across
an ocean of stars to reach you.

625
01:04:43,947 --> 01:04:47,952
For some time, your world
has sheltered one of my citizens.

626
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:51,794
I request that you return this individual...

627
01:04:52,055 --> 01:04:54,194
...to my custody.

628
01:04:54,424 --> 01:04:58,429
For reasons unknown,
he has chosen to keep his existence...

629
01:04:58,695 --> 01:05:00,538
...a secret from you.

630
01:05:01,598 --> 01:05:04,772
He will have made efforts to blend in.

631
01:05:05,368 --> 01:05:07,041
He will look like you.

632
01:05:07,771 --> 01:05:10,377
But he is not one of you.

633
01:05:11,574 --> 01:05:13,417
To those of you who may know...

634
01:05:13,643 --> 01:05:15,645
...of his current location...

635
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:18,449
mine fare of your planer."...

636
01:05:18,715 --> 01:05:21,389
...rests in your hands.

637
01:05:22,452 --> 01:05:25,490
To Kai-El, <i>I</i> say this:

638
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:30,231
Surrender within 24 hours...

639
01:05:34,497 --> 01:05:37,478
...or watch this world
suffer the consequences.

640
01:05:41,404 --> 01:05:42,075
Ah!

641
01:05:53,249 --> 01:05:55,092
We hardly know anything
about him, isn't that right?

642
01:05:55,251 --> 01:05:57,253
If he truly means us no harm...

643
01:05:57,487 --> 01:05:59,489
...he'll turn himself in
and face the consequences.

644
01:06:00,123 --> 01:06:01,329
And if he won't do that...

645
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:03,593
...then maybe we should.

646
01:06:03,827 --> 01:06:06,808
The Daily Planet's Lois Lane
knows who this guy is. Shek...

647
01:06:07,030 --> 01:06:07,940
...the one we should
be questioning.

648
01:06:08,932 --> 01:06:11,674
- Hold on. You're saying Lois Lane--
- Hello?

649
01:06:11,935 --> 01:06:14,438
Are you watching this crap?
Been running all morning.

650
01:06:14,671 --> 01:06:16,981
For once I agree with Woodburn.
Have you seen him?

651
01:06:17,207 --> 01:06:20,518
- Do you know where he is?
- No. Even if I did, I wouldn't say.

652
01:06:20,777 --> 01:06:23,951
The entire world is being threatened here.

653
01:06:24,180 --> 01:06:25,818
This is not time for you to fall...

654
01:06:26,049 --> 01:06:28,393
...back on journalistic integrity.

655
01:06:28,651 --> 01:06:30,130
This is serious, Lois.

656
01:06:30,353 --> 01:06:33,334
The FBI is here. They're throwing around
words like "treason."

657
01:06:33,556 --> 01:06:35,229
I gotta go-

658
01:06:51,374 --> 01:06:52,717
FBI. Hands up.

659
01:06:52,976 --> 01:06:54,751
Drop the bag. Now.

660
01:07:01,651 --> 01:07:03,892
Regarding the visitors
themselves we know...

661
01:07:04,153 --> 01:07:06,599
very little.
According to government officials...

662
01:07:06,856 --> 01:07:09,336
...the visitors do not represent a threat...

663
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,732
<i>despite the ominous tone</i>
<i>of their message.</i>

664
01:07:11,995 --> 01:07:14,498
Then of course there's the question
on everyonek mind:

665
01:07:14,731 --> 01:07:18,543
"Who is this Kal-El person?
Does he actually exist?

666
01:07:18,768 --> 01:07:21,442
How could he have remained
hidden from us for so long?"

667
01:07:26,075 --> 01:07:27,383
Come on, Kent.

668
01:07:34,450 --> 01:07:35,554
Come on. Fight back.

669
01:07:35,785 --> 01:07:37,389
Get up, Kent.

670
01:07:40,690 --> 01:07:42,067
So is that it?

671
01:07:42,525 --> 01:07:44,027
Is that all you've got?

672
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,197
Come on, Kent.

673
01:07:48,431 --> 01:07:49,808
Come on!

674
01:08:18,428 --> 01:08:19,566
Did they hurl you?

675
01:08:20,830 --> 01:08:22,241
You know they can't.

676
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:25,478
That's not what I meant.
I meant, are you all right?

677
01:08:27,470 --> 01:08:29,780
I wanted to hit that kid.
I wanted to hit him bad.

678
01:08:30,006 --> 01:08:31,485
I know you did. I mean...

679
01:08:31,741 --> 01:08:34,449
...part of me even wanted you to,
but then what?

680
01:08:35,144 --> 01:08:36,316
Make you feel any better?

681
01:08:39,682 --> 01:08:43,687
You just have to decide what kind of man
you want to grow up to be, Clark.

682
01:08:43,953 --> 01:08:47,662
Because whoever that man is,
good character or bad, he's...

683
01:08:49,292 --> 01:08:51,431
He's gonna change the world.

684
01:08:56,666 --> 01:08:57,701
What's on your mind?

685
01:09:03,773 --> 01:09:05,047
I don't know where to start.

686
01:09:05,675 --> 01:09:07,279
Wherever you want.

687
01:09:09,445 --> 01:09:11,550
That ship that appeared last night.

688
01:09:12,882 --> 01:09:14,691
I'm the one they're looking for.

689
01:09:19,188 --> 01:09:20,690
Do you know...

690
01:09:21,491 --> 01:09:22,629
...why they want you?

691
01:09:22,859 --> 01:09:25,465
No. But this General Zod...

692
01:09:25,695 --> 01:09:29,700
...even if I surrender, there's no guarantee
he'll keep his word, but...

693
01:09:29,966 --> 01:09:33,971
...if there's a chance I can save Earth
by turning myself in...

694
01:09:35,571 --> 01:09:36,709
...shouldn't I take it'?

695
01:09:38,207 --> 01:09:40,084
What does your gut tell you?

696
01:09:40,810 --> 01:09:42,517
Zod can't be trusted.

697
01:09:45,148 --> 01:09:46,718
The problem is...

698
01:09:47,750 --> 01:09:50,356
...I'm not sure the people of Earth
can be either.

699
01:09:58,361 --> 01:10:01,342
Sometimes you have to take
a leap of faith first.

700
01:10:02,732 --> 01:10:04,769
The trust part comes later.

701
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:31,633
All right. You've got our attention.

702
01:10:32,128 --> 01:10:33,129
What is it you want?

703
01:10:33,396 --> 01:10:35,205
I would like to speak to Lois Lane.

704
01:10:35,431 --> 01:10:36,705
What makes you think she's here?

705
01:10:37,633 --> 01:10:39,704
Don't play games with me, general.

706
01:10:39,936 --> 01:10:43,941
I'll surrender, but only if you
guarantee Lois's freedom.

707
01:10:54,050 --> 01:10:55,996
Why are you surrendering to Zod?

708
01:10:57,220 --> 01:11:00,827
I'm surrendering to mankind.
There's a difference.

709
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:03,904
You let them handcuff you?

710
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:07,073
Wouldn't be much of a surrender
if I resisted.

711
01:11:08,564 --> 01:11:10,601
And if it makes them feel more secure...

712
01:11:11,667 --> 01:11:13,510
...then all the better for it.

713
01:11:17,940 --> 01:11:19,112
What's the S stand for?

714
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:24,315
It's not an S.

715
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,352
On my world it means hope.

716
01:11:29,318 --> 01:11:32,822
Well, here, it's an S.

717
01:11:34,857 --> 01:11:36,427
How about...

718
01:11:40,763 --> 01:11:41,764
...Super--

719
01:11:41,998 --> 01:11:43,033
Sir?

720
01:11:43,299 --> 01:11:46,644
- Hi, my name is Dr. E--
Emil Hamilton.

721
01:11:46,869 --> 01:11:49,850
I know, I can see your ID tag
in your breast pocket.

722
01:11:50,106 --> 01:11:52,143
Along with a half-eaten roll of Lifesavers.

723
01:11:53,309 --> 01:11:55,653
I can also see the soldiers
in the next room...

724
01:11:55,878 --> 01:11:58,188
...preparing that tranquilizing agent
of yours.

725
01:11:58,447 --> 01:11:59,892
You won't need it.

726
01:12:00,149 --> 01:12:03,187
Sir, you can't expect us
to not take precautions.

727
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:05,864
You could be carrying
some kind of alien pathogen.

728
01:12:06,122 --> 01:12:07,567
Been here for 33 years, doctor.

729
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:11,738
- Haven't infected anyone yet.
- That you know of. We have legitimate...

730
01:12:11,994 --> 01:12:15,373
...security concerns. You revealed
your identity to Miss Lane over there.

731
01:12:16,365 --> 01:12:18,572
Why won't you do the same with us?

732
01:12:19,535 --> 01:12:21,879
Let's put our cards on the table here,
general.

733
01:12:23,339 --> 01:12:25,046
You're scared because you can't control me.

734
01:12:25,641 --> 01:12:28,178
You don't, and you never will.

735
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,991
But that doesn' mean I'm your enemy.

736
01:12:31,214 --> 01:12:32,716
Then who is'?

737
01:12:32,982 --> 01:12:34,393
Zod'?

738
01:12:35,017 --> 01:12:36,428
That's what I'm worried about.

739
01:12:37,019 --> 01:12:38,726
Be that as it may...

740
01:12:38,988 --> 01:12:41,764
...I've been given orders
to hand you over to him.

741
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:44,869
Do what you have to do, general.

742
01:12:49,665 --> 01:12:50,439
Thank you.

743
01:12:51,567 --> 01:12:52,545
For what?

744
01:12:53,703 --> 01:12:55,273
For believing in me.

745
01:12:58,341 --> 01:13:00,378
Didn't make much difference in the end.

746
01:13:01,210 --> 01:13:02,746
It did to me.

747
01:13:23,366 --> 01:13:24,902
They're coming.

748
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:27,203
You should leave now.

749
01:13:30,306 --> 01:13:31,876
Go, Lois.

750
01:14:42,778 --> 01:14:44,155
Kai-El.

751
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:46,717
I'm sub-commander Faora-Ul.

752
01:14:47,383 --> 01:14:50,660
On behalf of General Zod,
I extend you his greetings.

753
01:14:56,692 --> 01:14:59,798
- Are you the ranking officer here?
- I am.

754
01:15:00,029 --> 01:15:02,009
General Zod would like this woman...

755
01:15:02,231 --> 01:15:03,869
...to accompany me.

756
01:15:04,834 --> 01:15:05,972
You asked for the alien.

757
01:15:07,403 --> 01:15:10,350
You didn't say anything
about one of our own.

758
01:15:10,573 --> 01:15:13,713
Shall I tell the general
you're unwilling to comply?

759
01:15:13,976 --> 01:15:15,853
I don't care what you tell him.

760
01:15:18,848 --> 01:15:20,259
It's all right.

761
01:15:21,350 --> 01:15:22,556
I'll go.

762
01:16:05,394 --> 01:16:09,240
The atmospheric composition on our ship
is not compatible with humans.

763
01:16:09,465 --> 01:16:10,876
You need to wear a breather...

764
01:16:11,100 --> 01:16:12,773
...beyond this point.

765
01:16:37,927 --> 01:16:38,837
Kai-El.

766
01:16:40,796 --> 01:16:42,434
You have no idea how long...

767
01:16:42,665 --> 01:16:44,736
...we've been searching for you.

768
01:16:45,167 --> 01:16:46,168
I take it you're Zod?

769
01:16:46,435 --> 01:16:47,573
General Zod.

770
01:16:47,803 --> 01:16:49,612
- Our commander.
- it's all right, Faora.

771
01:16:49,839 --> 01:16:52,513
We can forgive Kal any lapses in decorum.

772
01:16:52,775 --> 01:16:54,686
He's a stranger to our ways.

773
01:16:54,944 --> 01:16:55,979
This should be cause...

774
01:16:56,245 --> 01:16:59,283
...for celebration, not conflict.

775
01:16:59,515 --> 01:17:01,688
- Unh.
- Not conflict.

776
01:17:04,120 --> 01:17:05,155
I...

777
01:17:05,421 --> 01:17:06,627
...feel strange.

778
01:17:09,358 --> 01:17:10,666
Weak.

779
01:17:12,862 --> 01:17:14,000
What's happening to him?

780
01:17:14,263 --> 01:17:16,800
He's rejecting our ship's atmospherics.

781
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:17,635
Clark.

782
01:17:17,867 --> 01:17:20,541
You've spent a lifetime
adapting to Earth's ecology...

783
01:17:20,703 --> 01:17:21,647
...but never adapted to ours.

784
01:17:21,804 --> 01:17:22,839
Help him.

785
01:17:23,105 --> 01:17:24,641
I can't. Whatever's happening...

786
01:17:24,874 --> 01:17:27,115
- ...has to run its course.
- Clark.

787
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,785
Help him.

788
01:17:31,547 --> 01:17:32,719
Help him.

789
01:17:44,360 --> 01:17:45,896
Hello, Kal.

790
01:17:47,563 --> 01:17:48,633
Or do you prefer Clark?

791
01:17:50,366 --> 01:17:51,743
That's the name they gave you.

792
01:17:52,001 --> 01:17:53,309
Isn't it?

793
01:17:54,570 --> 01:17:56,311
I was Krypton's military leader...

794
01:17:56,539 --> 01:17:58,985
...your father our foremost scientist.

795
01:17:59,208 --> 01:18:00,653
The only thing we agreed on...

796
01:18:00,876 --> 01:18:03,652
...was that Krypton was dying.
In return for my efforts...

797
01:18:03,879 --> 01:18:06,416
...to protect our civilization...

798
01:18:06,682 --> 01:18:08,753
...and save our planet...

799
01:18:09,018 --> 01:18:13,023
...I and my fellow officers
were sentenced to the Phantom Zone.

800
01:18:15,991 --> 01:18:19,234
And then the destruction of our world...

801
01:18:19,495 --> 01:18:20,997
...freed us.

802
01:18:26,168 --> 01:18:29,672
We were adrift, destined to ﬂoat...

803
01:18:29,905 --> 01:18:31,851
"amongst the ruins of our planet...

804
01:18:32,074 --> 01:18:33,951
...until we starved.

805
01:18:34,843 --> 01:18:36,447
How did you find your way to Earth?

806
01:18:37,213 --> 01:18:41,218
We managed to retrofit
the phantom projector into a hyperdrive.

807
01:18:41,717 --> 01:18:44,891
Your father made a similar modification
to the craft that brought you here.

808
01:18:46,922 --> 01:18:50,028
And so the instrument of our damnation...

809
01:18:52,061 --> 01:18:53,870
...became our salvation.

810
01:18:58,801 --> 01:19:01,304
We sought out the old colonial outposts...

811
01:19:01,570 --> 01:19:03,777
...looking for signs of life.

812
01:19:06,242 --> 01:19:09,052
But all we found was death.

813
01:19:10,045 --> 01:19:12,616
Cut off from Krypton, these outposts...

814
01:19:12,881 --> 01:19:15,088
mwithered and died long ago.

815
01:19:15,584 --> 01:19:17,564
We salvaged what we could...

816
01:19:17,786 --> 01:19:19,493
...3!'H? Of', “weapons...

817
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:21,666
...even a world engine.

818
01:19:23,425 --> 01:19:25,302
For 33 years we prepared...

819
01:19:26,795 --> 01:19:29,571
...until finally we detected
a distress beacon...

820
01:19:29,798 --> 01:19:31,607
...which you triggered...

821
01:19:31,834 --> 01:19:34,075
...when you accessed
the ancient scout ship.

822
01:19:35,471 --> 01:19:38,008
You led us here, Kal.

823
01:19:39,141 --> 01:19:40,484
Now it's within your power...

824
01:19:40,743 --> 01:19:44,350
...to save what remains of your race.

825
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,358
On Krypton...

826
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:53,259
...the genetic template
for every being yet to be born...

827
01:19:53,489 --> 01:19:56,026
...is encoded in the registry of citizens.

828
01:19:56,692 --> 01:19:58,831
Your father stole the registry's Codex...

829
01:19:59,094 --> 01:20:01,938
...and stored it in the capsule
that brought you here.

830
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:03,473
For what purpose?

831
01:20:04,533 --> 01:20:07,275
So that Krypton can live again...

832
01:20:08,137 --> 01:20:09,673
...on Earth.

833
01:20:29,525 --> 01:20:31,630
Where is the Codex, Kal?

834
01:20:33,295 --> 01:20:35,138
If Krypton lives again...

835
01:20:36,298 --> 01:20:37,675
...what happens to Earth?

836
01:20:38,701 --> 01:20:42,205
The foundation has to be
built on something.

837
01:20:42,471 --> 01:20:45,247
Even your father recognized that.

838
01:20:51,714 --> 01:20:54,024
No, Zod.

839
01:20:55,184 --> 01:20:56,390
I can't be a part of this.

840
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:58,926
Then what can you be a part of?

841
01:20:59,521 --> 01:21:00,727
No!

842
01:21:01,924 --> 01:21:02,527
Zod!

843
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:04,731
No!

844
01:21:05,894 --> 01:21:07,532
No!

845
01:21:13,569 --> 01:21:14,707
Your father acquitted...

846
01:21:14,937 --> 01:21:16,939
...himself with honor, Kal.

847
01:21:19,842 --> 01:21:21,788
You killed him?

848
01:21:22,177 --> 01:21:23,520
I did.

849
01:21:24,113 --> 01:21:27,526
And not a day goes by
where it doesn't haunt me.

850
01:21:28,884 --> 01:21:31,228
But if I had to do it again, I would.

851
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:34,923
I have a duty to my people...

852
01:21:35,190 --> 01:21:39,195
...and I will not allow anyone
to prevent me from carrying it out.

853
01:21:55,644 --> 01:21:57,282
What's the sit-rep, major?

854
01:21:57,913 --> 01:22:00,291
DSP pinged two bogeys
launching from the alien ship.

855
01:22:00,549 --> 01:22:02,654
- Put it up.
- Yes, sir.

856
01:22:03,085 --> 01:22:04,155
There it is.

857
01:22:04,420 --> 01:22:05,228
Re-task lkon-4...

858
01:22:05,454 --> 01:22:07,900
- ...and get me a closer look.
- Yes, sir.

859
01:22:08,223 --> 01:22:09,133
Command, the word...

860
01:22:09,391 --> 01:22:10,563
...of the day is trident.

861
01:22:10,793 --> 01:22:12,898
We have two alien craft
on aggressive approach.

862
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:14,766
Ikon-4 coming online.

863
01:22:14,997 --> 01:22:15,805
Air speed?

864
01:22:16,064 --> 01:22:17,475
380 knots, entering Kansas...

865
01:22:17,733 --> 01:22:19,735
...airspace.
Not responding to our hails.

866
01:22:19,968 --> 01:22:22,175
You're wasting your efforts.

867
01:22:23,105 --> 01:22:25,449
The strength you derived
from the Earth's sun...

868
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,779
...has been neutralized aboard our ship.

869
01:22:28,444 --> 01:22:29,582
Here...

870
01:22:29,812 --> 01:22:31,416
...in this environment...

871
01:22:32,181 --> 01:22:33,660
...you are as weak as a human.

872
01:22:36,251 --> 01:22:37,161
Unh!

873
01:22:41,123 --> 01:22:42,261
Unh!

874
01:23:32,207 --> 01:23:34,050
Where did you come from?

875
01:23:34,576 --> 01:23:36,021
The command key, Miss Lane.

876
01:23:36,245 --> 01:23:38,691
Thanks to you, I'm uploading
to the ship's mainframe.

877
01:23:39,915 --> 01:23:40,893
Who are you?

878
01:23:41,850 --> 01:23:43,158
I am Kai's father.

879
01:23:44,820 --> 01:23:45,560
Can you help us?

880
01:23:47,523 --> 01:23:49,366
I designed this ship.

881
01:23:49,591 --> 01:23:51,764
I can modify its atmospheric composition...

882
01:23:52,027 --> 01:23:53,768
...to human compatibility.

883
01:23:54,029 --> 01:23:54,871
We can stop them.

884
01:23:55,097 --> 01:23:57,577
We can send them back
to the Phantom Zone.

885
01:23:58,534 --> 01:23:59,171
How?

886
01:23:59,401 --> 01:24:00,937
I can teach you.

887
01:24:01,203 --> 01:24:03,012
And in turn, you can teach Kal.

888
01:24:03,238 --> 01:24:04,945
Will you help me?

889
01:24:18,787 --> 01:24:20,095
The ship's crew are alerted.

890
01:24:20,355 --> 01:24:21,390
We need to move quickly.

891
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:23,296
Retrieve the command key.

892
01:24:30,933 --> 01:24:33,971
- Did you do that?
- Yes. Pick up her sidearm.

893
01:24:43,378 --> 01:24:44,755
What's happening?

894
01:25:05,734 --> 01:25:06,405
To your right.

895
01:25:06,635 --> 01:25:07,272
Fire.

896
01:25:08,837 --> 01:25:09,577
Behind you.

897
01:25:23,085 --> 01:25:25,122
Secure yourself inside the open pod.

898
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:28,430
Safe travels, Miss Lane. It's unlikely...

899
01:25:28,657 --> 01:25:30,261
...we'll see each other again.

900
01:25:31,827 --> 01:25:34,933
Remember, the phantom drives
are essential in stopping them.

901
01:25:35,797 --> 01:25:37,037
Move your head to the left.

902
01:26:04,626 --> 01:26:06,537
Is it true what Zod said about the Codex?

903
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:09,040
Strike that panel.

904
01:26:12,701 --> 01:26:13,873
We wanted you to learn...

905
01:26:14,136 --> 01:26:16,241
...what it meant to be human first...

906
01:26:16,872 --> 01:26:20,513
...so that one day, when the time was right,
you could be the bridge...

907
01:26:20,742 --> 01:26:22,517
...between two peoples.

908
01:26:25,247 --> 01:26:26,021
Look.

909
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:30,424
Lois.

910
01:26:31,019 --> 01:26:32,054
You can save her, Kal.

911
01:26:35,190 --> 01:26:37,067
You can save all of them.

912
01:27:55,971 --> 01:27:57,507
You'll be safe here.

913
01:27:59,841 --> 01:28:02,412
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

914
01:28:05,647 --> 01:28:07,126
I'm sorry.

915
01:28:07,849 --> 01:28:10,830
I didn't wanna tell them anything,
but they did something to me.

916
01:28:11,086 --> 01:28:13,259
- They looked inside my mind--
- it's okay, Lois.

917
01:28:13,488 --> 01:28:15,263
They did the same thing to me.

918
01:28:28,336 --> 01:28:29,679
Clark!

919
01:28:38,680 --> 01:28:40,455
The craft he arrived in...

920
01:28:40,982 --> 01:28:42,154
...where is it?

921
01:28:44,052 --> 01:28:45,224
Go to hell.

922
01:28:56,531 --> 01:28:57,509
There.

923
01:28:58,900 --> 01:28:59,571
Unh!

924
01:29:20,522 --> 01:29:22,661
The Codex is not here.

925
01:29:23,758 --> 01:29:25,032
Argh!

926
01:29:26,094 --> 01:29:27,596
Ah!

927
01:29:29,397 --> 01:29:30,432
Where has he hidden it?

928
01:29:30,699 --> 01:29:31,336
I don't know.

929
01:29:31,566 --> 01:29:32,670
Where is the Codex?!

930
01:29:36,705 --> 01:29:38,048
Ahh!

931
01:29:48,683 --> 01:29:50,629
You think you can threaten my mother?!

932
01:29:56,224 --> 01:29:57,225
Ah!

933
01:30:32,427 --> 01:30:33,906
What have you done to me?

934
01:30:34,129 --> 01:30:36,575
My parents taught me to hone...

935
01:30:36,798 --> 01:30:38,277
...my senses, Zod.

936
01:30:39,968 --> 01:30:41,572
Focus...

937
01:30:42,137 --> 01:30:43,844
...on just what I wanted to see.

938
01:30:44,105 --> 01:30:45,140
Without your helmet...

939
01:30:45,407 --> 01:30:46,977
...you're getting everything.

940
01:30:47,175 --> 01:30:48,085
Unh!

941
01:30:48,243 --> 01:30:49,654
And it hurts...

942
01:30:50,245 --> 01:30:51,622
...doesn't it?

943
01:31:02,490 --> 01:31:03,992
Argh!

944
01:31:36,458 --> 01:31:37,732
Get away from the window.

945
01:31:40,695 --> 01:31:42,504
Get inside. It's not safe.

946
01:31:47,836 --> 01:31:50,715
Ail players, this is
Guardian. I am airborne mission commander.

947
01:31:50,972 --> 01:31:53,009
I have previously encountered
and observed...

948
01:31:53,241 --> 01:31:55,380
...the beings we're about to engage.

949
01:31:55,643 --> 01:31:58,351
They are extremely dangerous
and we have been authorized...

950
01:31:58,580 --> 01:32:00,082
...to use deadly force.

951
01:32:02,050 --> 01:32:04,030
Roger, Guardian, we are inbound to target.

952
01:32:09,691 --> 01:32:10,897
Cleared hot. Weapons free.

953
01:32:11,159 --> 01:32:12,763
Copy, 11. Weapons free.

954
01:32:15,563 --> 01:32:16,337
Thunder 11...

955
01:32:16,564 --> 01:32:17,599
...tally three targets.

956
01:32:29,077 --> 01:32:30,112
Unh!

957
01:32:35,216 --> 01:32:36,024
Thunder 11...

958
01:32:36,251 --> 01:32:38,697
...good hit.
Request immediate re-attack.

959
01:32:38,920 --> 01:32:41,059
Roger, Guardian.
We'll make a second gun run...

960
01:32:41,289 --> 01:32:43,394
...on a heading of 212 degrees.

961
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:51,376
Thunder 11, eject!

962
01:32:51,599 --> 01:32:52,976
Eject!

963
01:32:53,301 --> 01:32:54,939
Thunder 11, eject!

964
01:33:05,080 --> 01:33:06,650
I have a bogey incoming!

965
01:33:07,482 --> 01:33:08,927
Oh, shit.

966
01:33:23,832 --> 01:33:24,572
Argh!

967
01:33:27,102 --> 01:33:27,978
You are weak...

968
01:33:28,236 --> 01:33:29,340
...son of El.

969
01:33:29,604 --> 01:33:30,742
Unsure of yourself.

970
01:33:35,977 --> 01:33:38,958
The fact that you possess
a sense of morality...

971
01:33:39,180 --> 01:33:40,955
...and we do not...

972
01:33:41,182 --> 01:33:43,753
...gives us an evolutionary advantage.

973
01:33:47,255 --> 01:33:49,758
And if history has proven anything...

974
01:33:59,634 --> 01:34:03,207
...it is that evolution always wins.

975
01:34:04,873 --> 01:34:05,544
Ragh!

976
01:34:10,311 --> 01:34:11,483
Unh!

977
01:34:24,526 --> 01:34:26,028
CCT, we're approaching...

978
01:34:26,294 --> 01:34:28,137
...LZ Jayhawk. Get down in five.

979
01:34:28,363 --> 01:34:30,206
Let's go. Go to the LZ.

980
01:34:30,999 --> 01:34:32,171
Roger, sarge. let's go!

981
01:35:09,771 --> 01:35:11,079
All rangers, I need you...

982
01:35:11,339 --> 01:35:12,511
...to engage the targets.

983
01:35:13,007 --> 01:35:14,077
Guardian, this is Badger 01.

984
01:35:14,342 --> 01:35:15,616
What about the guy in blue?

985
01:35:15,877 --> 01:35:16,912
I said engage...

986
01:35:17,178 --> 01:35:18,350
...all targets.

987
01:35:29,524 --> 01:35:30,559
Contact. Contact.

988
01:35:34,929 --> 01:35:35,805
Ah!

989
01:35:40,735 --> 01:35:41,577
You Okay?

990
01:35:47,308 --> 01:35:49,413
We're auto-rotating, going in hard.

991
01:35:50,144 --> 01:35:51,316
Brace for impact.

992
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:53,251
Brace for impact.

993
01:35:53,481 --> 01:35:54,459
We're going in hard!

994
01:35:59,554 --> 01:36:03,559
Fallen angel. Fallen angel.
Guardian is down. I repeat, Guardian is down.

995
01:36:25,480 --> 01:36:26,982
Guardian, do you read?

996
01:36:27,248 --> 01:36:28,591
Thunder 12, calling Guardian.

997
01:36:28,816 --> 01:36:30,159
- Do you read?
- Thunder 12...

998
01:36:30,418 --> 01:36:31,328
...this is Guardian.

999
01:36:31,586 --> 01:36:33,964
Put down everything you've got
north of my position.

1000
01:36:34,188 --> 01:36:36,361
- This will be danger-close.
- Copy, danger-close.

1001
01:36:36,624 --> 01:36:37,864
Good luck, sir.

1002
01:37:17,732 --> 01:37:20,576
A good death is its own reward.

1003
01:37:34,182 --> 01:37:35,559
You will not win.

1004
01:37:36,984 --> 01:37:38,520
For every human you save...

1005
01:37:38,753 --> 01:37:41,427
...we will kill a million more. Unh!

1006
01:38:32,740 --> 01:38:35,914
Do we have an all clear?
Do we have an all clear?

1007
01:38:36,144 --> 01:38:38,420
Alpha team, sit-rep. Alpha team.

1008
01:38:38,646 --> 01:38:40,250
Do you copy? Alpha team.

1009
01:39:29,764 --> 01:39:31,971
This man is not our enemy.

1010
01:39:34,435 --> 01:39:35,971
Thank you, colonel.

1011
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:54,663
Mom'?

1012
01:39:55,957 --> 01:39:57,630
I'm all right.

1013
01:40:09,670 --> 01:40:11,650
Nice suit, son.

1014
01:40:12,707 --> 01:40:14,015
I'm so sorry.

1015
01:40:15,042 --> 01:40:17,352
It's only stuff, Clark.

1016
01:40:18,513 --> 01:40:20,925
It can always be replaced.

1017
01:40:23,384 --> 01:40:24,658
But you can't be.

1018
01:40:25,987 --> 01:40:28,399
Mom, Zod said this Codex...

1019
01:40:28,656 --> 01:40:30,932
...he's looking for can
bring my people back.

1020
01:40:31,259 --> 01:40:32,932
Isn't that a good thing?

1021
01:40:37,164 --> 01:40:39,667
I don't think they're interested
in sharing this world.

1022
01:40:40,268 --> 01:40:41,508
Clark.

1023
01:40:42,236 --> 01:40:43,112
Clark.

1024
01:40:45,006 --> 01:40:46,883
I know how to stop them.

1025
01:40:48,943 --> 01:40:50,388
What happened down there?

1026
01:40:50,611 --> 01:40:53,455
He exposed a temporary weakness.

1027
01:40:54,348 --> 01:40:56,191
It is of little consequence...

1028
01:40:57,552 --> 01:41:00,465
...because I have located the Codex.

1029
01:41:01,255 --> 01:41:03,531
It was never in the capsule.

1030
01:41:04,125 --> 01:41:05,798
<i>Jor-el took the Codex---</i>

1031
01:41:06,060 --> 01:41:08,540
...the DNA of a billion people,
then he bonded it...

1032
01:41:08,763 --> 01:41:10,572
...within his son's individual...

1033
01:41:10,798 --> 01:41:11,742
cells.

1034
01:41:11,966 --> 01:41:13,570
All of Krypton's heirs...

1035
01:41:13,801 --> 01:41:17,248
...living hidden in one refugee's body.

1036
01:41:21,309 --> 01:41:23,289
Does Kal-EI need to be alive...

1037
01:41:23,544 --> 01:41:26,718
...for us to extract the Codex from his cells?

1038
01:41:28,082 --> 01:41:29,254
No.

1039
01:41:35,156 --> 01:41:37,432
Release the world engine.

1040
01:42:09,657 --> 01:42:10,601
“Mat just happened?

1041
01:42:10,758 --> 01:42:11,930
The ship just split in mo.

1042
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:15,265
Track one is heading east,
track two to the southern hemisphere.

1043
01:42:15,496 --> 01:42:17,942
- How fast is that bogey moving?
- Approaching...

1044
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:19,610
...Mach 24 and accelerating.

1045
01:42:19,834 --> 01:42:22,508
It's gonna impact
somewhere in the Indian Ocean.

1046
01:42:41,222 --> 01:42:42,860
The rest of the ship is descending.

1047
01:42:43,858 --> 01:42:44,996
Put it on the board now.

1048
01:42:45,226 --> 01:42:46,296
Yes, sir.

1049
01:42:47,328 --> 01:42:48,500
Oh, my God.

1050
01:43:29,003 --> 01:43:31,779
Bring the phantom drive online.

1051
01:43:53,394 --> 01:43:55,237
We are now slave to the world engine.

1052
01:43:56,964 --> 01:43:58,375
Initiate.

1053
01:44:32,433 --> 01:44:35,846
- What have they hit us with?
- Looks like some kind of gravity...

1054
01:44:36,103 --> 01:44:38,640
...weapon.
It's working in tandem with their ship.

1055
01:44:40,074 --> 01:44:43,146
Somehow they're increasing
the Earth's mass...

1056
01:44:43,410 --> 01:44:45,515
...clouding the atmosphere
with particulates.

1057
01:44:47,248 --> 01:44:48,852
Oh, my God.

1058
01:44:50,184 --> 01:44:51,185
They're terraforming.

1059
01:44:51,952 --> 01:44:52,760
What's that?

1060
01:44:53,587 --> 01:44:54,691
Planetary engineering...

1061
01:44:54,955 --> 01:44:58,164
...modifying the Earth's atmosphere
and topography.

1062
01:44:58,425 --> 01:44:59,665
Turning Earth into Krypton.

1063
01:45:00,361 --> 01:45:03,501
- But what happens to us?
- Based on these readings...

1064
01:45:03,764 --> 01:45:06,768
...there won't be an "us."
General Swanwick, sir.

1065
01:45:07,168 --> 01:45:08,545
I'm on with the control tower.

1066
01:45:08,803 --> 01:45:11,044
Colonel Hardy's on his way
and he's got Superman in tow.

1067
01:45:11,772 --> 01:45:12,842
Superman?

1068
01:45:13,374 --> 01:45:14,546
The alien, sir.

1069
01:45:14,809 --> 01:45:17,187
That's what they're calling him.
Superman.

1070
01:45:22,683 --> 01:45:23,889
We have a plan, general.

1071
01:45:24,151 --> 01:45:25,630
Is that what I think it is?

1072
01:45:26,787 --> 01:45:28,562
It's the ship he arrived in.

1073
01:45:30,224 --> 01:45:32,864
This ship is powered by something
called a phantom drive.

1074
01:45:33,127 --> 01:45:34,572
It bends space.

1075
01:45:34,829 --> 01:45:38,800
Zod's ship uses the same technology,
and if we can make the two drives collide--

1076
01:45:39,033 --> 01:45:40,876
A singularity can be created.

1077
01:45:41,135 --> 01:45:42,170
- Like a black hole.
- Yes.

1078
01:45:42,703 --> 01:45:44,205
So if we open up this doorway...

1079
01:45:44,471 --> 01:45:46,075
...they should be pulled back in.

1080
01:45:46,340 --> 01:45:48,843
So you want us to bomb them with that?

1081
01:45:49,076 --> 01:45:51,056
General, that craft maxes out...

1082
01:45:51,312 --> 01:45:54,691
...17,000 pounds,
we can drop it from a C-17.

1083
01:45:54,915 --> 01:45:56,053
It's a viable plan.

1084
01:45:56,317 --> 01:45:58,422
If I don't stop that machine
over the Indian Ocean...

1085
01:45:58,686 --> 01:46:00,393
...the gravity field will continue...

1086
01:46:00,654 --> 01:46:01,997
...to expand.

1087
01:46:07,761 --> 01:46:10,537
If that thing is making Earth
more like Krypton...

1088
01:46:10,898 --> 01:46:12,434
...won't you be weaker around it?

1089
01:46:14,235 --> 01:46:15,543
Maybe.

1090
01:46:16,403 --> 01:46:18,883
I'm not about to let that
stop me from trying.

1091
01:46:19,840 --> 01:46:22,047
You might want to step back a little bit.

1092
01:46:24,111 --> 01:46:25,249
Maybe a little bit more.

1093
01:46:57,711 --> 01:46:58,314
Faora.

1094
01:46:59,313 --> 01:47:00,417
Take command.

1095
01:47:00,648 --> 01:47:03,788
- Yes, sir.
- I need to secure the genesis chamber...

1096
01:47:04,218 --> 01:47:06,960
...and pay my respects to an old friend.

1097
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:16,833
Guardian en route to Metropolis...

1098
01:47:17,631 --> 01:47:18,837
...package in tow.

1099
01:47:24,104 --> 01:47:27,017
Be advised,
F-35s inbound to rendezvous point.

1100
01:47:27,274 --> 01:47:29,447
You should have visual contact now.

1101
01:48:14,455 --> 01:48:18,130
Command key accepted.
Genesis chamber coming online, sir.

1102
01:48:18,525 --> 01:48:19,469
Stop this, Zod...

1103
01:48:19,693 --> 01:48:21,832
...while there's still time.

1104
01:48:23,063 --> 01:48:26,374
Haven't given up lecturing me,
have you, even in death?

1105
01:48:26,734 --> 01:48:28,736
I will not let you use the Codex like this.

1106
01:48:29,003 --> 01:48:30,710
You don't have the power to stop me.

1107
01:48:30,971 --> 01:48:34,009
The command key I have entered
is revoking your authority.

1108
01:48:34,241 --> 01:48:37,154
This ship is now under my control.

1109
01:49:08,675 --> 01:49:10,245
Norlhcom, Lightning 1, request...

1110
01:49:10,511 --> 01:49:12,923
- ...permission to unleash the hounds.
- Lightning 1...

1111
01:49:13,180 --> 01:49:16,627
...you are clear to engage. Send battle
damage assessment when able. Out.

1112
01:49:30,197 --> 01:49:32,575
Avionics are going haywire.
The gravity field...

1113
01:49:32,800 --> 01:49:35,144
...is pulling our missiles down.
We gotta get closer.

1114
01:49:40,240 --> 01:49:41,275
All right, everybody...

1115
01:49:41,542 --> 01:49:44,421
...we're leaving.
We're leaving the building now.

1116
01:50:07,568 --> 01:50:09,445
I just lost my wingman.

1117
01:50:11,805 --> 01:50:12,943
Mayday! Mayday! Mayday!

1118
01:50:24,518 --> 01:50:26,498
Everybody, this way! Come on!

1119
01:50:26,753 --> 01:50:29,825
Everybody, come on!
Keep moving, keep moving.

1120
01:50:36,663 --> 01:50:37,698
Jenny!

1121
01:50:41,668 --> 01:50:42,510
Oh, my God.

1122
01:50:42,769 --> 01:50:43,770
Perry!

1123
01:50:48,208 --> 01:50:50,154
Go! There! Go!

1124
01:50:56,016 --> 01:50:57,518
Our people can co-exist.

1125
01:50:58,152 --> 01:51:02,157
So we can suffer through years of pain
trying to adapt like your son has?

1126
01:51:02,990 --> 01:51:04,663
- You're talking about genocide.
- Yes.

1127
01:51:04,892 --> 01:51:07,498
And I'm arguing its merits with a ghost.

1128
01:51:08,862 --> 01:51:10,671
We're both ghosts, Zod.

1129
01:51:10,898 --> 01:51:14,402
Can't you see that?
The Krypton you're clinging onto is gone.

1130
01:51:14,668 --> 01:51:17,239
Ship, have you managed to quarantine
this invasive intelligence?

1131
01:51:17,504 --> 01:51:18,380
- You'll fail.
- I have.

1132
01:51:18,639 --> 01:51:20,050
Then prepare to terminate it.

1133
01:51:20,307 --> 01:51:22,082
- I'm tired of this debate.
Silencing me...

1134
01:51:22,342 --> 01:51:23,753
...won't change anything.

1135
01:51:26,013 --> 01:51:27,321
My son...

1136
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:29,491
...is twice the man you were.

1137
01:51:32,486 --> 01:51:34,159
And he will finish what we started.

1138
01:51:35,088 --> 01:51:36,328
I can promise you that.

1139
01:51:41,528 --> 01:51:42,905
Tell me...

1140
01:51:43,163 --> 01:51:46,736
...you have Jor-El's memories,
his conscience.

1141
01:51:47,434 --> 01:51:48,435
Can you experience...

1142
01:51:48,702 --> 01:51:49,840
...his pain?

1143
01:51:51,872 --> 01:51:55,445
I will harvest the Codex
from your son's corpse...

1144
01:51:55,909 --> 01:51:58,219
...and I will rebuild Krypton...

1145
01:51:58,445 --> 01:52:00,948
..atop his bones.

1146
01:52:29,276 --> 01:52:30,584
Argh!

1147
01:52:58,639 --> 01:52:59,344
Jenny.

1148
01:52:59,606 --> 01:53:02,348
- Jenny. Jenny, where are you?
- I'm here!

1149
01:53:02,609 --> 01:53:03,644
- I'm here. Here.
- Jenny.

1150
01:53:03,910 --> 01:53:05,412
Hold on, hold on.

1151
01:53:05,646 --> 01:53:06,624
I'm stuck.

1152
01:53:06,847 --> 01:53:08,520
- I can't get free. I'm stuck.
- Okay.

1153
01:53:08,782 --> 01:53:11,319
We'll get you out of there, all right?
Just sit tight.

1154
01:53:11,585 --> 01:53:12,154
No, no, no!

1155
01:53:12,419 --> 01:53:14,126
- Don't leave me.
- We're not gonna leave you.

1156
01:53:14,354 --> 01:53:15,526
- Okay.
- Lombard!

1157
01:53:15,789 --> 01:53:19,134
- Get your ass over here and help me.
- Damn it.

1158
01:53:21,128 --> 01:53:23,108
- We just gotta move this.
- Here.

1159
01:53:23,330 --> 01:53:25,367
Slide that in. You push, I'll pull, okay?

1160
01:53:25,632 --> 01:53:26,667
Go.

1161
01:53:30,871 --> 01:53:32,179
- Push!
- Oh, my God.

1162
01:53:32,439 --> 01:53:34,043
It's getting closer! Come on, push!

1163
01:53:36,109 --> 01:53:38,316
Northcom, this is Guardian.
Are we cleared?

1164
01:53:38,845 --> 01:53:39,846
Negative, Guardian.

1165
01:54:04,571 --> 01:54:07,017
Come on! Push!

1166
01:54:07,207 --> 01:54:08,208
Ahh!

1167
01:54:33,200 --> 01:54:35,180
Argh!

1168
01:54:59,025 --> 01:55:00,368
He did it.

1169
01:55:02,562 --> 01:55:03,802
Northcom, this is Guardian.

1170
01:55:04,064 --> 01:55:06,305
We're passing through phase line red.
Good to go.

1171
01:55:06,566 --> 01:55:07,476
Godspeed, Guardian.

1172
01:55:07,734 --> 01:55:10,146
Arm the package. You are cleared hot.

1173
01:55:10,404 --> 01:55:12,475
We're lining up for the final run.

1174
01:55:13,273 --> 01:55:15,275
It's up to you and Hamilton now.

1175
01:55:55,449 --> 01:55:56,189
You gotta be kidding me.

1176
01:55:56,450 --> 01:55:57,861
Loadmaster, is the package...

1177
01:55:58,118 --> 01:55:59,119
...ready to drop?

1178
01:55:59,352 --> 01:56:00,626
Negative, Guardian.

1179
01:56:00,854 --> 01:56:02,424
There's something wrong.
It's not supposed to do this.

1180
01:56:02,656 --> 01:56:04,431
What's it supposed to do?

1181
01:56:04,658 --> 01:56:07,696
- It's supposed to go in all the way.
- Let me take a look.

1182
01:56:07,961 --> 01:56:09,531
'Se-pilot's aircraft.

1183
01:56:10,263 --> 01:56:11,765
Sea-pilot's aircraft.

1184
01:56:18,505 --> 01:56:21,179
We are lined up for the drop.
What's the hold up?

1185
01:56:21,441 --> 01:56:22,442
We've had a setback.

1186
01:56:38,191 --> 01:56:39,693
Target that aircraft.

1187
01:56:43,563 --> 01:56:45,008
Target locked.

1188
01:56:54,808 --> 01:56:55,684
Stop!

1189
01:56:55,909 --> 01:56:58,014
If you destroy this ship...

1190
01:56:58,245 --> 01:57:00,919
...you destroy Krypton!

1191
01:57:03,717 --> 01:57:05,890
Krypton had its chance.

1192
01:57:07,420 --> 01:57:09,195
Argh!

1193
01:57:59,873 --> 01:58:01,750
Miss Lane! It's not safe for you...

1194
01:58:01,975 --> 01:58:02,885
...over there!

1195
01:58:03,109 --> 01:58:03,712
Miss Lane!

1196
01:58:05,312 --> 01:58:06,552
Ah!

1197
01:58:33,607 --> 01:58:35,348
Move now! Go!

1198
01:58:56,196 --> 01:58:57,197
A good death...

1199
01:58:57,464 --> 01:58:59,034
...is its own reward.

1200
01:59:06,640 --> 01:59:08,017
Ah!

1201
01:59:29,562 --> 01:59:30,632
Ah!

1202
01:59:47,414 --> 01:59:48,825
Argh!

1203
02:00:01,494 --> 02:00:02,939
Are they gone?

1204
02:00:04,097 --> 02:00:05,508
I think so.

1205
02:00:07,400 --> 02:00:08,743
He saved us.

1206
02:00:34,227 --> 02:00:37,436
You know, they say it's all downhill
after the first kiss.

1207
02:00:40,900 --> 02:00:43,938
I'm pretty sure that only counts
when you're kissing a human.

1208
02:01:13,299 --> 02:01:14,778
Look at this.

1209
02:01:17,070 --> 02:01:18,981
We could have built a new Krypton...

1210
02:01:19,239 --> 02:01:20,980
...in this squalor.

1211
02:01:21,241 --> 02:01:24,347
But you chose the humans over us.

1212
02:01:25,779 --> 02:01:27,315
I exist...

1213
02:01:27,580 --> 02:01:29,992
...only to protect Krypton.

1214
02:01:31,751 --> 02:01:35,756
That is the sole purpose
for which I was born.

1215
02:01:36,990 --> 02:01:39,129
And every action I take...

1216
02:01:39,359 --> 02:01:41,361
...no matter how violent...

1217
02:01:41,628 --> 02:01:43,335
...or how cruel...

1218
02:01:44,531 --> 02:01:46,943
...is for the greater good...

1219
02:01:47,167 --> 02:01:49,113
...of my people.

1220
02:01:53,439 --> 02:01:54,850
And now...

1221
02:01:55,108 --> 02:01:57,384
...I have no people.

1222
02:02:00,814 --> 02:02:02,384
My soul...

1223
02:02:04,484 --> 02:02:08,022
...that is what you have taken...

1224
02:02:08,288 --> 02:02:09,892
...from me.

1225
02:02:16,796 --> 02:02:19,299
I'm going to make them suffer, Kal.

1226
02:02:19,532 --> 02:02:22,979
These humans you've adopted,
I will take them all from you...

1227
02:02:23,203 --> 02:02:26,184
...one by one.
- You're a monster, Zod...

1228
02:02:28,808 --> 02:02:30,014
...and I'm gonna stop you.

1229
02:02:42,488 --> 02:02:43,694
Argh!

1230
02:02:51,998 --> 02:02:52,669
Argh!

1231
02:04:11,611 --> 02:04:12,316
There's only...

1232
02:04:12,578 --> 02:04:13,921
...one way this ends, Kal.

1233
02:04:14,147 --> 02:04:15,990
Either you die...

1234
02:04:16,249 --> 02:04:17,023
...or I do.

1235
02:04:38,204 --> 02:04:39,114
Unh!

1236
02:04:48,681 --> 02:04:50,820
I was bred to be a warrior, Kal.

1237
02:04:51,684 --> 02:04:53,322
Trained my entire life...

1238
02:04:53,553 --> 02:04:55,396
...to master my senses.

1239
02:04:55,888 --> 02:04:59,495
Where did you train? On a farm?

1240
02:06:51,270 --> 02:06:52,908
Argh!

1241
02:07:08,421 --> 02:07:09,866
If you love...

1242
02:07:10,123 --> 02:07:12,467
...these people so much...

1243
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:15,468
...you can mourn for them.

1244
02:07:19,932 --> 02:07:21,002
Don't do this!

1245
02:07:24,203 --> 02:07:25,011
Stop!

1246
02:07:31,377 --> 02:07:32,355
Stop!

1247
02:07:34,714 --> 02:07:35,852
Never.

1248
02:08:05,845 --> 02:08:07,347
Ahh!

1249
02:09:10,543 --> 02:09:11,920
Are you effing stupid?

1250
02:09:12,144 --> 02:09:13,885
It's one of your surveillance drones.

1251
02:09:14,113 --> 02:09:16,616
That's a $12,000,000 piece of hardware.

1252
02:09:16,782 --> 02:09:17,817
It was.

1253
02:09:18,618 --> 02:09:21,155
I know you're trying to find out
where I hang my cape.

1254
02:09:21,754 --> 02:09:23,233
- You won't.
- Then I'll ask...

1255
02:09:23,456 --> 02:09:24,764
...the obvious question:

1256
02:09:25,224 --> 02:09:28,228
How do we know you won't one day
act against America's interests?

1257
02:09:28,928 --> 02:09:30,771
I grew up in Kansas, general.

1258
02:09:31,230 --> 02:09:33,403
I'm about as American as it gets.

1259
02:09:33,666 --> 02:09:34,576
Look...

1260
02:09:34,800 --> 02:09:36,279
...I'm hereto help...

1261
02:09:36,502 --> 02:09:38,743
...but it has to be on my own terms.

1262
02:09:38,971 --> 02:09:40,814
You have to convince Washington of that.

1263
02:09:41,073 --> 02:09:45,078
Even if I were willing to try,
what makes you think they'd listen?

1264
02:09:46,145 --> 02:09:47,749
I don't know, general.

1265
02:09:49,148 --> 02:09:50,855
Guess I'll just have to trust you.

1266
02:10:00,426 --> 02:10:01,803
What are you smiling about?

1267
02:10:02,628 --> 02:10:03,971
Nothing, sir.

1268
02:10:07,133 --> 02:10:09,113
I just think he's kind of hot.

1269
02:10:11,270 --> 02:10:13,375
- Get in the car, captain.
- Mm-hm. Yes, sir.

1270
02:10:23,349 --> 02:10:26,558
He always believed
you were meant for greater things.

1271
02:10:26,819 --> 02:10:28,321
And that when the day came...

1272
02:10:28,554 --> 02:10:31,364
...your shoulders would be able
to bear the weight.

1273
02:10:31,624 --> 02:10:35,470
Yeah, I just wish he could have
been here to see it finally happen.

1274
02:10:35,895 --> 02:10:37,875
He saw it, Clark, believe me.

1275
02:11:25,378 --> 02:11:28,222
What are you going to do
when you're not saving the world?

1276
02:11:28,447 --> 02:11:32,190
- Have you given any thought to that?
- I have, actually. Heh, heh.

1277
02:11:33,786 --> 02:11:37,791
I gotta find a job
where I can keep my ear to the ground.

1278
02:11:43,028 --> 02:11:45,099
Where people won't look twice...

1279
02:11:45,364 --> 02:11:49,141
...when I want to go somewhere dangerous
and start asking questions.

1280
02:12:03,249 --> 02:12:06,287
Come on, Lois.
When are you gonna throw me a bone?

1281
02:12:07,553 --> 02:12:09,226
Courtside seats to the game tonight.

1282
02:12:09,655 --> 02:12:11,225
- What do you say?
- I say...

1283
02:12:11,457 --> 02:12:13,994
...you should go back
to trolling the intern pool.

1284
02:12:14,260 --> 02:12:17,639
You'll probably have more luck. Sorry.

1285
02:12:19,432 --> 02:12:20,103
Courtside?

1286
02:12:20,332 --> 02:12:22,073
- Don't. Ha, ha, ha.
- No.

1287
02:12:22,301 --> 02:12:25,111
Lombard, Lane,
I want you to meet our new stringer.

1288
02:12:25,337 --> 02:12:28,580
I want you to show him the ropes.
This is Clark Kent.

1289
02:12:28,808 --> 02:12:30,116
Good luck, kid.

1290
02:12:31,644 --> 02:12:32,918
Hey. Steve.

1291
02:12:33,145 --> 02:12:34,419
- Nice to meet you.
- You too.

1292
02:12:34,647 --> 02:12:35,489
Hi.

1293
02:12:36,415 --> 02:12:37,758
Lois Lane.

1294
02:12:38,584 --> 02:12:40,120
Welcome to the Planet.

1295
02:12:43,856 --> 02:12:45,836
Glad to be here, Lois.
